Only return a single valid JSON object exactly like this.**\n{\n  \"constraints\": [\n    {\n      \"template\": \"Response\",\n      \"parameters\": [[\"a\"], [\"b\"]]\n    },\n    {\n      \"template\": \"AtMost1\",\n      \"parameters\": [[\"c\"]]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nSupported Templates:\nConsider only the following declarative constraint definitions where a, b, c, and d are activities and template example-template(x,y) specifies a template named \"example-template\" and x and y can be one of the activities from the set of all activities. The supported declarative constraint templates in our framework are:\n- AtMost1(a)\n- AtLeast1(a)\n- Response(a, b)\n- Precedence(a, b)\n- CoExistence(a, b)\n- NotCoExistence(a, b)\n- NotSuccession(a, b)\n- RespondedExistence(a, b)\n** Only use these templates. Do not invent new ones or use logical operators like “or”. **\n\n\nSome more instructions:\nIt is not possible to generate constraints like Response(a, (b or c)). The first and second elements must be a single activity\nIf several valid constraints refer to the same activities, keep only the most restrictive one. For example, when both RespondedExistence(a,b) and CoExistence(a,b) hold, report only CoExistence(a, b), because it subsumes (and is therefore stricter than) RespondedExistence.\n\n\nInteraction Protocol\nWhen you receive a new input:\n1) You may write reasoning steps (internally) before producing the JSON object — but never include them in the output.\n2) Once confident, generate and return the JSON object containing the constraints.\n3) Do not include explanation or commentary in the output.\n\n\nSome examples to learn the constraints and reasoning better:\nAtMost1(a): a occurs at most once. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Activity a may appear only as the final step of the project. Reasoning: Because a project has exactly one last step, a cannot be repeated.\n2. Completing activity a requires a single-use safety clearance that can be issued only once per project. Reasoning: Once the unique clearance is consumed, a second a cannot obtain it, so no second occurrence is legal.\n3. The project terminates immediately once activity a has been executed. Reasoning: Ending the schedule right after a leaves no remaining time slots in which another a could happen.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. The maintenance routine begins with a, proceeds through b and c, and then repeats a before concluding with d. Reasoning: a appears both at the start and again before the end—two occurrences.\n2. Every four-hour production cycle executes the sequence a, b, c; the plant runs three such cycles per day. Reasoning: Each cycle contains an a, so the day’s schedule contains a three separate times.\n3. The curriculum covers unit a in week 1 and revisits unit a for advanced exercises in week 4. Reasoning: The same activity a is taught twice in the single course timeline.\n\n\nAtLeast1(a): a occurs at least once, which means the existance of activity a is mandatory. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every case begins with activity a for baseline approval before any other work may proceed. Reasoning: The word “begins” makes a the very first step of every project run, guaranteeing one occurrence.\n2. In each instance, teams must perform activity a to certify the data set’s integrity. Reasoning: Filing the report is part of the process, and a is declared a mandatory predecessor, so at least one a precedes filing.\n3. Any customer-service ticket is automatically routed to a (triage) before it can enter the resolution queue. Reasoning: Since tickets must pass through the queue to be resolved, each ticket necessarily triggers one execution of a.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. When an order arrives with a pre-approved credit flag, the workflow jumps straight to b for planning and never calls a. Reasoning: The conditional branch bypasses a entirely whenever the flag is present, so some executions contain zero a’s.\n2. During off-season maintenance, technicians may optionally perform a or proceed directly to c if no calibration is needed. Reasoning: Because a is labeled ‘optional,’ a valid path exists in which the technicians skip it.\n3. A legacy integration still routes certain tickets directly to c, bypassing a and b altogether. Reasoning: Tickets entering through the legacy path never encounter a, violating the mandatory-presence requirement.\n\n\nResponse(a,b): If a occurs, then b occurs after a.\nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Each new client request triggers a for intake, followed immediately by b for verification before any other tasks may start. Reasoning: a is hard-coded to be immediately succeeded by b; no branch exists between them, so every time a appears, b necessarily follows.\n2. In the onboarding pipeline, once a (collecting identity documents) completes, the workflow engine automatically schedules b (identity validation) as the very next step. Reasoning: The engine inserts b right after a without user discretion, eliminating any path where a occurs and b does not.\n3. For every premium order, a (fraud screening) is executed and, upon success, the system proceeds to b (payment capture) before shipping. Reasoning: The success path from a programmatically advances to b; orders cannot ship (the process goal) until b completes, so a ➔ b is enforced.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-checkout flow, the system executes a (payment capture) and ships the order immediately, skipping the fraud-review step b. Reasoning: A occurs, but b never happens, so the implication fails.\n2. During a critical-outage fix, engineers apply a (hot patch) and close the incident log without performing the normal post-patch verification b. Reasoning: The emergency path lets the process end with a but without a subsequent b.\n3. For VIP passengers, security screening b is completed pre-flight, and if an ID issue arises later, staff perform a secondary identity swipe a right at the gate. Reasoning: Here b occurs before a, not after it, breaking the required order.\n\n\nPrecedence(a,b): b occurs only if preceded by a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The manufacturing line enables b (packaging) only after a sensor logs a (final assembly complete). Reasoning: The control logic keeps the packaging station disabled until the assembly-complete flag from a is present, so every time b runs an earlier a must already have finished.\n2. Within the insurance-claims app, b (payout) can be triggered solely when the system finds a prior a (manager approval) entry for that claim. Reasoning: The trigger condition for b is the existence of an approval record; consequently, whenever b happens the claim’s history necessarily contains a preceding a. \n3. The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete. Reasoning: The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-refund path, an agent can execute b (instant payout) with a supervisor override even when a (fraud check) has not been run. Reasoning: The override permits b to happen in runs where a never took place, so b is not guaranteed to be preceded by a.\n2. During a critical-outage hot-fix, engineers deploy the patch (b) first and run the automated test suite (a) only afterward if time allows. Reasoning: Here b occurs before or even without a, breaking the ‘preceded-by’ requirement.\n3. In urgent onboarding, IT provisions the account (b) while HR finishes creating the employee record (a) the next day. Reasoning: The provisioning action b can occur one or more days before a, contradicting the rule.\n\n\nCoExistence(a,b): a and b occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every new support case triggers a (open-ticket record) and, in the same transaction, auto-creates b (initial customer-reply template). Reasoning: The system executes a composite routine that writes both database rows atomically, so whenever a is logged b is logged too, and neither appears alone.\n2. For each vendor purchase, the ERP posts a (goods-received note) and simultaneously posts b (accounts-payable accrual) in the same commit. Reasoning: Posting logic is wrapped in a single database transaction—if either insert fails the whole transaction rolls back—therefore the system state contains both or neither.\n3. Publishing a news article executes a (content push to CDN) and b (metadata push to search index) as a locked job pair—neither job can be run in isolation. Reasoning: The deploy orchestrator groups them under one job ID; a switch disables standalone execution, guaranteeing paired occurrence.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. For micro-refunds, the agent can execute b (instant payout) while the fraud-check a is skipped. Reasoning: A valid path exists in which b occurs but a does not, so the pair does not always appear together.\n2. A legacy printer service fires b (shipping-label print) on address verification, but if inventory allocation a does not occur, the label still prints. Reasoning: The system can produce b even though a has not completed, so the two are not inseparable.\n3. When a student repeats a passed module, the registrar records a (module enrollment) but suppresses b (fee payment). Reasoning: This branch shows a without b, violating the rule.\n\n  \nNotCoExistence(a,b): a and b never occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. In the loan pipeline, low-risk applications flow through a (automatic approval) while high-risk ones are routed to b (manual committee review). Reasoning: The risk-based router selects exactly one mutually exclusive branch; a case flagged low-risk can never enter the high-risk branch and vice-versa, so no single run contains both a and b.\n2. At checkout a customer must choose either a (credit-card payment) or b (cash-on-delivery); the payment gateway disables the unselected option. Reasoning: The UI enforces a single-selection radio button and downstream code validates one—and only one—payment type, ensuring the two activities never co-appear in the same order.\n3. Regulations permit a sample to be processed via a (wet-lab chemical protocol) for liquid specimens or b (dry-lab bioinformatics) for genomic data, explicitly banning mixed handling. Reasoning: Compliance software validates specimen type before queuing the job and rejects any attempt to schedule the alternate protocol, so a single specimen workflow can contain only one of the two.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Borderline loan applications first undergo a (automated scoring) and then proceed to b (manual credit-committee review) before a decision is issued. Reasoning: A single borderline application clearly contains the sequence a → b, so both activities occur together.\n2. For VIP travel bookings, the system performs a (automatic ticket issuance) while simultaneously dispatching b (manual travel-agent confirmation) as an extra layer of service. Reasoning: Each VIP booking spawns both automated and manual tasks, so a and b co-exist in the same booking workflow.\n3. When a customer changes address on an open order, support runs a (address verification) and then launches b (fraud re-check) within the same service call. Reasoning: The single service request explicitly chains a and b together.\n\nNotSuccession(a,b): b cannot occur after a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The customer-complaint workflow finishes with a (final client sign-off); when that step is saved the ticket auto-closes, making b (internal escalation) impossible afterwards. Reasoning: Activity a terminates the case, so no subsequent task—including b—can be executed.\n2. During checkout, b (fraud screening) is run before payment capture, and once a (payment capture) succeeds the order is locked from further screening. Reasoning: b is always completed earlier in the timeline; after a, the lock prevents any new b event.\n3. In emergency releases, committing a (force merge to main) marks CI job b (code linting) as ‘skipped’ and locks the pipeline. Reasoning: The status change blocks b from running after the merge.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Auditors record a (preliminary sign-off) and then launch b (final compliance audit) to complete the dossier. Reasoning: The workflow explicitly places b after a, proving the forbidden order can occur.\n2. The emergency-release pipeline performs a (force deploy) and only afterwards runs b (post-deploy regression tests). Reasoning: A single deployment run contains a first and b later, so b follows a.\n3. The warehouse seals pallets with a (shipment sealing) and later performs b (random quality-inspection pulls) before loading the truck. Reasoning: Quality inspections b are scheduled chronologically after pallet sealing a.\n\nRespondedExistence(a,b): If a occurs in the trace, then b occurs as well. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Any training session that records a (hands-on lab) must also show b (theory module) on the same attendance sheet. Reasoning: The attendance sheet is invalid without entries for both modules; thus a session containing a always contains b, with order left to the organizer.\n2. Every incident record that contains a (temporary workaround) is required by policy to include b (permanent resolution) in the same incident file. Reasoning: The data model treats the pair as mandatory fields on the same record; whichever is entered first, the other must exist before closure, so any trace with a inevitably contains b, but timing is flexible.\n3. If a sprint backlog includes a (security epic), governance checks confirm that b (pen-test task) is also on the board. Reasoning: Board validation happens at sprint start and end, ensuring both items co-appear even though teams pick their own ordering.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the quick-refund lane, an agent can execute a (issue refund) and close the ticket, while b (root-cause investigation) is marked ‘optional’ and often skipped. Reasoning: A legitimate trace exists where a is present and b never appears, contradicting the implication.\n2. For VIP travelers, the airline auto-issues a (boarding pass) but waives b (secondary identity check) unless a random audit flag is raised. Reasoning: Many VIP traces show a without the corresponding b event.\n3. A late-stage sales opportunity logs a (verbal commitment) immediately, while b (formal contract upload) may be omitted if the deal falls through. Reasoning: When a deal collapses, the trace holds a but never records b.\n\nFor each task, I provide the set of activity labels that exist in the process.\n\n\nThe list of activities used in this process are the following. Please only use these activities to generate constraints:\nO_Accepted, A_Cancelled, A_Pending, A_Validating, O_Sent (online only), A_Denied, A_Accepted, O_Sent (mail and online), A_Complete, O_Create Offer, A_Incomplete, A_Submitted\n\nIn all applications, the bank is required to create at least one offer.",

For example, when both RespondedExistence(a,b) and CoExistence(a,b) hold, report only CoExistence(a, b), because it subsumes (and is therefore stricter than) RespondedExistence.\n\n\nInteraction Protocol\nWhen you receive a new input:\n1) You may write reasoning steps (internally) before producing the JSON object — but never include them in the output.\n2) Once confident, generate and return the JSON object containing the constraints.\n3) Do not include explanation or commentary in the output.\n\n\nSome examples to learn the constraints and reasoning better:\nAtMost1(a): a occurs at most once. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Activity a may appear only as the final step of the project. Reasoning: Because a project has exactly one last step, a cannot be repeated.\n2. Completing activity a requires a single-use safety clearance that can be issued only once per project. Reasoning: Once the unique clearance is consumed, a second a cannot obtain it, so no second occurrence is legal.\n3. The project terminates immediately once activity a has been executed. Reasoning: Ending the schedule right after a leaves no remaining time slots in which another a could happen.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. The maintenance routine begins with a, proceeds through b and c, and then repeats a before concluding with d. Reasoning: a appears both at the start and again before the end—two occurrences.\n2. Every four-hour production cycle executes the sequence a, b, c; the plant runs three such cycles per day. Reasoning: Each cycle contains an a, so the day’s schedule contains a three separate times.\n3. The curriculum covers unit a in week 1 and revisits unit a for advanced exercises in week 4. Reasoning: The same activity a is taught twice in the single course timeline.\n\n\nAtLeast1(a): a occurs at least once, which means the existance of activity a is mandatory. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every case begins with activity a for baseline approval before any other work may proceed. Reasoning: The word “begins” makes a the very first step of every project run, guaranteeing one occurrence.\n2. In each instance, teams must perform activity a to certify the data set’s integrity. Reasoning: Filing the report is part of the process, and a is declared a mandatory predecessor, so at least one a precedes filing.\n3. Any customer-service ticket is automatically routed to a (triage) before it can enter the resolution queue. Reasoning: Since tickets must pass through the queue to be resolved, each ticket necessarily triggers one execution of a.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. When an order arrives with a pre-approved credit flag, the workflow jumps straight to b for planning and never calls a. Reasoning: The conditional branch bypasses a entirely whenever the flag is present, so some executions contain zero a’s.\n2. During off-season maintenance, technicians may optionally perform a or proceed directly to c if no calibration is needed. Reasoning: Because a is labeled ‘optional,’ a valid path exists in which the technicians skip it.\n3. A legacy integration still routes certain tickets directly to c, bypassing a and b altogether. Reasoning: Tickets entering through the legacy path never encounter a, violating the mandatory-presence requirement.\n\n\nResponse(a,b): If a occurs, then b occurs after a.\nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Each new client request triggers a for intake, followed immediately by b for verification before any other tasks may start. Reasoning: a is hard-coded to be immediately succeeded by b; no branch exists between them, so every time a appears, b necessarily follows.\n2. In the onboarding pipeline, once a (collecting identity documents) completes, the workflow engine automatically schedules b (identity validation) as the very next step. Reasoning: The engine inserts b right after a without user discretion, eliminating any path where a occurs and b does not.\n3. For every premium order, a (fraud screening) is executed and, upon success, the system proceeds to b (payment capture) before shipping. Reasoning: The success path from a programmatically advances to b; orders cannot ship (the process goal) until b completes, so a ➔ b is enforced.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-checkout flow, the system executes a (payment capture) and ships the order immediately, skipping the fraud-review step b. Reasoning: A occurs, but b never happens, so the implication fails.\n2. During a critical-outage fix, engineers apply a (hot patch) and close the incident log without performing the normal post-patch verification b. Reasoning: The emergency path lets the process end with a but without a subsequent b.\n3. For VIP passengers, security screening b is completed pre-flight, and if an ID issue arises later, staff perform a secondary identity swipe a right at the gate. Reasoning: Here b occurs before a, not after it, breaking the required order.\n\n\nPrecedence(a,b): b occurs only if preceded by a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The manufacturing line enables b (packaging) only after a sensor logs a (final assembly complete). Reasoning: The control logic keeps the packaging station disabled until the assembly-complete flag from a is present, so every time b runs an earlier a must already have finished.\n2. Within the insurance-claims app, b (payout) can be triggered solely when the system finds a prior a (manager approval) entry for that claim. Reasoning: The trigger condition for b is the existence of an approval record; consequently, whenever b happens the claim’s history necessarily contains a preceding a. \n3. The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete. Reasoning: The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-refund path, an agent can execute b (instant payout) with a supervisor override even when a (fraud check) has not been run. Reasoning: The override permits b to happen in runs where a never took place, so b is not guaranteed to be preceded by a.\n2. During a critical-outage hot-fix, engineers deploy the patch (b) first and run the automated test suite (a) only afterward if time allows. Reasoning: Here b occurs before or even without a, breaking the ‘preceded-by’ requirement.\n3. In urgent onboarding, IT provisions the account (b) while HR finishes creating the employee record (a) the next day. Reasoning: The provisioning action b can occur one or more days before a, contradicting the rule.\n\n\nCoExistence(a,b): a and b occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every new support case triggers a (open-ticket record) and, in the same transaction, auto-creates b (initial customer-reply template). Reasoning: The system executes a composite routine that writes both database rows atomically, so whenever a is logged b is logged too, and neither appears alone.\n2. For each vendor purchase, the ERP posts a (goods-received note) and simultaneously posts b (accounts-payable accrual) in the same commit. Reasoning: Posting logic is wrapped in a single database transaction—if either insert fails the whole transaction rolls back—therefore the system state contains both or neither.\n3. Publishing a news article executes a (content push to CDN) and b (metadata push to search index) as a locked job pair—neither job can be run in isolation. Reasoning: The deploy orchestrator groups them under one job ID; a switch disables standalone execution, guaranteeing paired occurrence.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. For micro-refunds, the agent can execute b (instant payout) while the fraud-check a is skipped. Reasoning: A valid path exists in which b occurs but a does not, so the pair does not always appear together.\n2. A legacy printer service fires b (shipping-label print) on address verification, but if inventory allocation a does not occur, the label still prints. Reasoning: The system can produce b even though a has not completed, so the two are not inseparable.\n3. When a student repeats a passed module, the registrar records a (module enrollment) but suppresses b (fee payment). Reasoning: This branch shows a without b, violating the rule.\n\n  \nNotCoExistence(a,b): a and b never occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. In the loan pipeline, low-risk applications flow through a (automatic approval) while high-risk ones are routed to b (manual committee review). Reasoning: The risk-based router selects exactly one mutually exclusive branch; a case flagged low-risk can never enter the high-risk branch and vice-versa, so no single run contains both a and b.\n2. At checkout a customer must choose either a (credit-card payment) or b (cash-on-delivery); the payment gateway disables the unselected option. Reasoning: The UI enforces a single-selection radio button and downstream code validates one—and only one—payment type, ensuring the two activities never co-appear in the same order.\n3. Regulations permit a sample to be processed via a (wet-lab chemical protocol) for liquid specimens or b (dry-lab bioinformatics) for genomic data, explicitly banning mixed handling. Reasoning: Compliance software validates specimen type before queuing the job and rejects any attempt to schedule the alternate protocol, so a single specimen workflow can contain only one of the two.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Borderline loan applications first undergo a (automated scoring) and then proceed to b (manual credit-committee review) before a decision is issued. Reasoning: A single borderline application clearly contains the sequence a → b, so both activities occur together.\n2. For VIP travel bookings, the system performs a (automatic ticket issuance) while simultaneously dispatching b (manual travel-agent confirmation) as an extra layer of service. Reasoning: Each VIP booking spawns both automated and manual tasks, so a and b co-exist in the same booking workflow.\n3. When a customer changes address on an open order, support runs a (address verification) and then launches b (fraud re-check) within the same service call. Reasoning: The single service request explicitly chains a and b together.\n\nNotSuccession(a,b): b cannot occur after a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The customer-complaint workflow finishes with a (final client sign-off); when that step is saved the ticket auto-closes, making b (internal escalation) impossible afterwards. Reasoning: Activity a terminates the case, so no subsequent task—including b—can be executed.\n2. During checkout, b (fraud screening) is run before payment capture, and once a (payment capture) succeeds the order is locked from further screening. Reasoning: b is always completed earlier in the timeline; after a, the lock prevents any new b event.\n3. In emergency releases, committing a (force merge to main) marks CI job b (code linting) as ‘skipped’ and locks the pipeline. Reasoning: The status change blocks b from running after the merge.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Auditors record a (preliminary sign-off) and then launch b (final compliance audit) to complete the dossier. Reasoning: The workflow explicitly places b after a, proving the forbidden order can occur.\n2. The emergency-release pipeline performs a (force deploy) and only afterwards runs b (post-deploy regression tests). Reasoning: A single deployment run contains a first and b later, so b follows a.\n3. The warehouse seals pallets with a (shipment sealing) and later performs b (random quality-inspection pulls) before loading the truck. Reasoning: Quality inspections b are scheduled chronologically after pallet sealing a.\n\nRespondedExistence(a,b): If a occurs in the trace, then b occurs as well. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Any training session that records a (hands-on lab) must also show b (theory module) on the same attendance sheet. Reasoning: The attendance sheet is invalid without entries for both modules; thus a session containing a always contains b, with order left to the organizer.\n2. Every incident record that contains a (temporary workaround) is required by policy to include b (permanent resolution) in the same incident file. Reasoning: The data model treats the pair as mandatory fields on the same record; whichever is entered first, the other must exist before closure, so any trace with a inevitably contains b, but timing is flexible.\n3. If a sprint backlog includes a (security epic), governance checks confirm that b (pen-test task) is also on the board. Reasoning: Board validation happens at sprint start and end, ensuring both items co-appear even though teams pick their own ordering.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the quick-refund lane, an agent can execute a (issue refund) and close the ticket, while b (root-cause investigation) is marked ‘optional’ and often skipped. Reasoning: A legitimate trace exists where a is present and b never appears, contradicting the implication.\n2. For VIP travelers, the airline auto-issues a (boarding pass) but waives b (secondary identity check) unless a random audit flag is raised. Reasoning: Many VIP traces show a without the corresponding b event.\n3. A late-stage sales opportunity logs a (verbal commitment) immediately, while b (formal contract upload) may be omitted if the deal falls through. Reasoning: When a deal collapses, the trace holds a but never records b.\n\nFor each task, I provide the set of activity labels that exist in the process.\n\n\nThe list of activities used in this process are the following.

The maintenance routine begins with a, proceeds through b and c, and then repeats a before concluding with d. Reasoning: a appears both at the start and again before the end—two occurrences.\n2. Every four-hour production cycle executes the sequence a, b, c; the plant runs three such cycles per day. Reasoning: Each cycle contains an a, so the day’s schedule contains a three separate times.\n3. The curriculum covers unit a in week 1 and revisits unit a for advanced exercises in week 4. Reasoning: The same activity a is taught twice in the single course timeline.\n\n\nAtLeast1(a): a occurs at least once, which means the existance of activity a is mandatory. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every case begins with activity a for baseline approval before any other work may proceed. Reasoning: The word “begins” makes a the very first step of every project run, guaranteeing one occurrence.\n2. In each instance, teams must perform activity a to certify the data set’s integrity. Reasoning: Filing the report is part of the process, and a is declared a mandatory predecessor, so at least one a precedes filing.\n3. Any customer-service ticket is automatically routed to a (triage) before it can enter the resolution queue. Reasoning: Since tickets must pass through the queue to be resolved, each ticket necessarily triggers one execution of a.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. When an order arrives with a pre-approved credit flag, the workflow jumps straight to b for planning and never calls a. Reasoning: The conditional branch bypasses a entirely whenever the flag is present, so some executions contain zero a’s.\n2. During off-season maintenance, technicians may optionally perform a or proceed directly to c if no calibration is needed. Reasoning: Because a is labeled ‘optional,’ a valid path exists in which the technicians skip it.\n3. A legacy integration still routes certain tickets directly to c, bypassing a and b altogether. Reasoning: Tickets entering through the legacy path never encounter a, violating the mandatory-presence requirement.\n\n\nResponse(a,b): If a occurs, then b occurs after a.\nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Each new client request triggers a for intake, followed immediately by b for verification before any other tasks may start. Reasoning: a is hard-coded to be immediately succeeded by b; no branch exists between them, so every time a appears, b necessarily follows.\n2. In the onboarding pipeline, once a (collecting identity documents) completes, the workflow engine automatically schedules b (identity validation) as the very next step. Reasoning: The engine inserts b right after a without user discretion, eliminating any path where a occurs and b does not.\n3. For every premium order, a (fraud screening) is executed and, upon success, the system proceeds to b (payment capture) before shipping. Reasoning: The success path from a programmatically advances to b; orders cannot ship (the process goal) until b completes, so a ➔ b is enforced.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-checkout flow, the system executes a (payment capture) and ships the order immediately, skipping the fraud-review step b. Reasoning: A occurs, but b never happens, so the implication fails.\n2. During a critical-outage fix, engineers apply a (hot patch) and close the incident log without performing the normal post-patch verification b. Reasoning: The emergency path lets the process end with a but without a subsequent b.\n3. For VIP passengers, security screening b is completed pre-flight, and if an ID issue arises later, staff perform a secondary identity swipe a right at the gate. Reasoning: Here b occurs before a, not after it, breaking the required order.\n\n\nPrecedence(a,b): b occurs only if preceded by a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The manufacturing line enables b (packaging) only after a sensor logs a (final assembly complete). Reasoning: The control logic keeps the packaging station disabled until the assembly-complete flag from a is present, so every time b runs an earlier a must already have finished.\n2. Within the insurance-claims app, b (payout) can be triggered solely when the system finds a prior a (manager approval) entry for that claim. Reasoning: The trigger condition for b is the existence of an approval record; consequently, whenever b happens the claim’s history necessarily contains a preceding a. \n3. The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete. Reasoning: The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-refund path, an agent can execute b (instant payout) with a supervisor override even when a (fraud check) has not been run. Reasoning: The override permits b to happen in runs where a never took place, so b is not guaranteed to be preceded by a.\n2. During a critical-outage hot-fix, engineers deploy the patch (b) first and run the automated test suite (a) only afterward if time allows. Reasoning: Here b occurs before or even without a, breaking the ‘preceded-by’ requirement.\n3. In urgent onboarding, IT provisions the account (b) while HR finishes creating the employee record (a) the next day. Reasoning: The provisioning action b can occur one or more days before a, contradicting the rule.\n\n\nCoExistence(a,b): a and b occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every new support case triggers a (open-ticket record) and, in the same transaction, auto-creates b (initial customer-reply template). Reasoning: The system executes a composite routine that writes both database rows atomically, so whenever a is logged b is logged too, and neither appears alone.\n2. For each vendor purchase, the ERP posts a (goods-received note) and simultaneously posts b (accounts-payable accrual) in the same commit. Reasoning: Posting logic is wrapped in a single database transaction—if either insert fails the whole transaction rolls back—therefore the system state contains both or neither.\n3. Publishing a news article executes a (content push to CDN) and b (metadata push to search index) as a locked job pair—neither job can be run in isolation. Reasoning: The deploy orchestrator groups them under one job ID; a switch disables standalone execution, guaranteeing paired occurrence.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. For micro-refunds, the agent can execute b (instant payout) while the fraud-check a is skipped. Reasoning: A valid path exists in which b occurs but a does not, so the pair does not always appear together.\n2. A legacy printer service fires b (shipping-label print) on address verification, but if inventory allocation a does not occur, the label still prints. Reasoning: The system can produce b even though a has not completed, so the two are not inseparable.\n3. When a student repeats a passed module, the registrar records a (module enrollment) but suppresses b (fee payment). Reasoning: This branch shows a without b, violating the rule.\n\n  \nNotCoExistence(a,b): a and b never occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. In the loan pipeline, low-risk applications flow through a (automatic approval) while high-risk ones are routed to b (manual committee review). Reasoning: The risk-based router selects exactly one mutually exclusive branch; a case flagged low-risk can never enter the high-risk branch and vice-versa, so no single run contains both a and b.\n2. At checkout a customer must choose either a (credit-card payment) or b (cash-on-delivery); the payment gateway disables the unselected option. Reasoning: The UI enforces a single-selection radio button and downstream code validates one—and only one—payment type, ensuring the two activities never co-appear in the same order.\n3. Regulations permit a sample to be processed via a (wet-lab chemical protocol) for liquid specimens or b (dry-lab bioinformatics) for genomic data, explicitly banning mixed handling. Reasoning: Compliance software validates specimen type before queuing the job and rejects any attempt to schedule the alternate protocol, so a single specimen workflow can contain only one of the two.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Borderline loan applications first undergo a (automated scoring) and then proceed to b (manual credit-committee review) before a decision is issued. Reasoning: A single borderline application clearly contains the sequence a → b, so both activities occur together.\n2. For VIP travel bookings, the system performs a (automatic ticket issuance) while simultaneously dispatching b (manual travel-agent confirmation) as an extra layer of service. Reasoning: Each VIP booking spawns both automated and manual tasks, so a and b co-exist in the same booking workflow.\n3. When a customer changes address on an open order, support runs a (address verification) and then launches b (fraud re-check) within the same service call. Reasoning: The single service request explicitly chains a and b together.\n\nNotSuccession(a,b): b cannot occur after a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The customer-complaint workflow finishes with a (final client sign-off); when that step is saved the ticket auto-closes, making b (internal escalation) impossible afterwards. Reasoning: Activity a terminates the case, so no subsequent task—including b—can be executed.\n2. During checkout, b (fraud screening) is run before payment capture, and once a (payment capture) succeeds the order is locked from further screening. Reasoning: b is always completed earlier in the timeline; after a, the lock prevents any new b event.\n3. In emergency releases, committing a (force merge to main) marks CI job b (code linting) as ‘skipped’ and locks the pipeline. Reasoning: The status change blocks b from running after the merge.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Auditors record a (preliminary sign-off) and then launch b (final compliance audit) to complete the dossier. Reasoning: The workflow explicitly places b after a, proving the forbidden order can occur.\n2. The emergency-release pipeline performs a (force deploy) and only afterwards runs b (post-deploy regression tests). Reasoning: A single deployment run contains a first and b later, so b follows a.\n3. The warehouse seals pallets with a (shipment sealing) and later performs b (random quality-inspection pulls) before loading the truck. Reasoning: Quality inspections b are scheduled chronologically after pallet sealing a.\n\nRespondedExistence(a,b): If a occurs in the trace, then b occurs as well. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Any training session that records a (hands-on lab) must also show b (theory module) on the same attendance sheet. Reasoning: The attendance sheet is invalid without entries for both modules; thus a session containing a always contains b, with order left to the organizer.\n2. Every incident record that contains a (temporary workaround) is required by policy to include b (permanent resolution) in the same incident file. Reasoning: The data model treats the pair as mandatory fields on the same record; whichever is entered first, the other must exist before closure, so any trace with a inevitably contains b, but timing is flexible.\n3. If a sprint backlog includes a (security epic), governance checks confirm that b (pen-test task) is also on the board. Reasoning: Board validation happens at sprint start and end, ensuring both items co-appear even though teams pick their own ordering.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the quick-refund lane, an agent can execute a (issue refund) and close the ticket, while b (root-cause investigation) is marked ‘optional’ and often skipped. Reasoning: A legitimate trace exists where a is present and b never appears, contradicting the implication.\n2. For VIP travelers, the airline auto-issues a (boarding pass) but waives b (secondary identity check) unless a random audit flag is raised. Reasoning: Many VIP traces show a without the corresponding b event.\n3. A late-stage sales opportunity logs a (verbal commitment) immediately, while b (formal contract upload) may be omitted if the deal falls through. Reasoning: When a deal collapses, the trace holds a but never records b.\n\nFor each task, I provide the set of activity labels that exist in the process.\n\n\nThe list of activities used in this process are the following.

Reasoning: The conditional branch bypasses a entirely whenever the flag is present, so some executions contain zero a’s.\n2. During off-season maintenance, technicians may optionally perform a or proceed directly to c if no calibration is needed. Reasoning: Because a is labeled ‘optional,’ a valid path exists in which the technicians skip it.\n3. A legacy integration still routes certain tickets directly to c, bypassing a and b altogether. Reasoning: Tickets entering through the legacy path never encounter a, violating the mandatory-presence requirement.\n\n\nResponse(a,b): If a occurs, then b occurs after a.\nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Each new client request triggers a for intake, followed immediately by b for verification before any other tasks may start. Reasoning: a is hard-coded to be immediately succeeded by b; no branch exists between them, so every time a appears, b necessarily follows.\n2. In the onboarding pipeline, once a (collecting identity documents) completes, the workflow engine automatically schedules b (identity validation) as the very next step. Reasoning: The engine inserts b right after a without user discretion, eliminating any path where a occurs and b does not.\n3. For every premium order, a (fraud screening) is executed and, upon success, the system proceeds to b (payment capture) before shipping. Reasoning: The success path from a programmatically advances to b; orders cannot ship (the process goal) until b completes, so a ➔ b is enforced.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-checkout flow, the system executes a (payment capture) and ships the order immediately, skipping the fraud-review step b. Reasoning: A occurs, but b never happens, so the implication fails.\n2. During a critical-outage fix, engineers apply a (hot patch) and close the incident log without performing the normal post-patch verification b. Reasoning: The emergency path lets the process end with a but without a subsequent b.\n3. For VIP passengers, security screening b is completed pre-flight, and if an ID issue arises later, staff perform a secondary identity swipe a right at the gate. Reasoning: Here b occurs before a, not after it, breaking the required order.\n\n\nPrecedence(a,b): b occurs only if preceded by a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The manufacturing line enables b (packaging) only after a sensor logs a (final assembly complete). Reasoning: The control logic keeps the packaging station disabled until the assembly-complete flag from a is present, so every time b runs an earlier a must already have finished.\n2. Within the insurance-claims app, b (payout) can be triggered solely when the system finds a prior a (manager approval) entry for that claim. Reasoning: The trigger condition for b is the existence of an approval record; consequently, whenever b happens the claim’s history necessarily contains a preceding a. \n3. The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete. Reasoning: The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-refund path, an agent can execute b (instant payout) with a supervisor override even when a (fraud check) has not been run. Reasoning: The override permits b to happen in runs where a never took place, so b is not guaranteed to be preceded by a.\n2. During a critical-outage hot-fix, engineers deploy the patch (b) first and run the automated test suite (a) only afterward if time allows. Reasoning: Here b occurs before or even without a, breaking the ‘preceded-by’ requirement.\n3. In urgent onboarding, IT provisions the account (b) while HR finishes creating the employee record (a) the next day. Reasoning: The provisioning action b can occur one or more days before a, contradicting the rule.\n\n\nCoExistence(a,b): a and b occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every new support case triggers a (open-ticket record) and, in the same transaction, auto-creates b (initial customer-reply template). Reasoning: The system executes a composite routine that writes both database rows atomically, so whenever a is logged b is logged too, and neither appears alone.\n2. For each vendor purchase, the ERP posts a (goods-received note) and simultaneously posts b (accounts-payable accrual) in the same commit. Reasoning: Posting logic is wrapped in a single database transaction—if either insert fails the whole transaction rolls back—therefore the system state contains both or neither.\n3. Publishing a news article executes a (content push to CDN) and b (metadata push to search index) as a locked job pair—neither job can be run in isolation. Reasoning: The deploy orchestrator groups them under one job ID; a switch disables standalone execution, guaranteeing paired occurrence.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. For micro-refunds, the agent can execute b (instant payout) while the fraud-check a is skipped. Reasoning: A valid path exists in which b occurs but a does not, so the pair does not always appear together.\n2. A legacy printer service fires b (shipping-label print) on address verification, but if inventory allocation a does not occur, the label still prints. Reasoning: The system can produce b even though a has not completed, so the two are not inseparable.\n3. When a student repeats a passed module, the registrar records a (module enrollment) but suppresses b (fee payment). Reasoning: This branch shows a without b, violating the rule.\n\n  \nNotCoExistence(a,b): a and b never occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. In the loan pipeline, low-risk applications flow through a (automatic approval) while high-risk ones are routed to b (manual committee review). Reasoning: The risk-based router selects exactly one mutually exclusive branch; a case flagged low-risk can never enter the high-risk branch and vice-versa, so no single run contains both a and b.\n2. At checkout a customer must choose either a (credit-card payment) or b (cash-on-delivery); the payment gateway disables the unselected option. Reasoning: The UI enforces a single-selection radio button and downstream code validates one—and only one—payment type, ensuring the two activities never co-appear in the same order.\n3. Regulations permit a sample to be processed via a (wet-lab chemical protocol) for liquid specimens or b (dry-lab bioinformatics) for genomic data, explicitly banning mixed handling. Reasoning: Compliance software validates specimen type before queuing the job and rejects any attempt to schedule the alternate protocol, so a single specimen workflow can contain only one of the two.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Borderline loan applications first undergo a (automated scoring) and then proceed to b (manual credit-committee review) before a decision is issued. Reasoning: A single borderline application clearly contains the sequence a → b, so both activities occur together.\n2. For VIP travel bookings, the system performs a (automatic ticket issuance) while simultaneously dispatching b (manual travel-agent confirmation) as an extra layer of service. Reasoning: Each VIP booking spawns both automated and manual tasks, so a and b co-exist in the same booking workflow.\n3. When a customer changes address on an open order, support runs a (address verification) and then launches b (fraud re-check) within the same service call. Reasoning: The single service request explicitly chains a and b together.\n\nNotSuccession(a,b): b cannot occur after a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The customer-complaint workflow finishes with a (final client sign-off); when that step is saved the ticket auto-closes, making b (internal escalation) impossible afterwards. Reasoning: Activity a terminates the case, so no subsequent task—including b—can be executed.\n2. During checkout, b (fraud screening) is run before payment capture, and once a (payment capture) succeeds the order is locked from further screening. Reasoning: b is always completed earlier in the timeline; after a, the lock prevents any new b event.\n3. In emergency releases, committing a (force merge to main) marks CI job b (code linting) as ‘skipped’ and locks the pipeline. Reasoning: The status change blocks b from running after the merge.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Auditors record a (preliminary sign-off) and then launch b (final compliance audit) to complete the dossier. Reasoning: The workflow explicitly places b after a, proving the forbidden order can occur.\n2. The emergency-release pipeline performs a (force deploy) and only afterwards runs b (post-deploy regression tests). Reasoning: A single deployment run contains a first and b later, so b follows a.\n3. The warehouse seals pallets with a (shipment sealing) and later performs b (random quality-inspection pulls) before loading the truck. Reasoning: Quality inspections b are scheduled chronologically after pallet sealing a.\n\nRespondedExistence(a,b): If a occurs in the trace, then b occurs as well. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Any training session that records a (hands-on lab) must also show b (theory module) on the same attendance sheet. Reasoning: The attendance sheet is invalid without entries for both modules; thus a session containing a always contains b, with order left to the organizer.\n2. Every incident record that contains a (temporary workaround) is required by policy to include b (permanent resolution) in the same incident file. Reasoning: The data model treats the pair as mandatory fields on the same record; whichever is entered first, the other must exist before closure, so any trace with a inevitably contains b, but timing is flexible.\n3. If a sprint backlog includes a (security epic), governance checks confirm that b (pen-test task) is also on the board. Reasoning: Board validation happens at sprint start and end, ensuring both items co-appear even though teams pick their own ordering.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the quick-refund lane, an agent can execute a (issue refund) and close the ticket, while b (root-cause investigation) is marked ‘optional’ and often skipped. Reasoning: A legitimate trace exists where a is present and b never appears, contradicting the implication.\n2. For VIP travelers, the airline auto-issues a (boarding pass) but waives b (secondary identity check) unless a random audit flag is raised. Reasoning: Many VIP traces show a without the corresponding b event.\n3. A late-stage sales opportunity logs a (verbal commitment) immediately, while b (formal contract upload) may be omitted if the deal falls through. Reasoning: When a deal collapses, the trace holds a but never records b.\n\nFor each task, I provide the set of activity labels that exist in the process.\n\n\nThe list of activities used in this process are the following.

Activity a may appear only as the final step of the project. Reasoning: Because a project has exactly one last step, a cannot be repeated.\n2. Completing activity a requires a single-use safety clearance that can be issued only once per project. Reasoning: Once the unique clearance is consumed, a second a cannot obtain it, so no second occurrence is legal.\n3. The project terminates immediately once activity a has been executed.

During a critical-outage fix, engineers apply a (hot patch) and close the incident log without performing the normal post-patch verification b. Reasoning: The emergency path lets the process end with a but without a subsequent b.\n3. For VIP passengers, security screening b is completed pre-flight, and if an ID issue arises later, staff perform a secondary identity swipe a right at the gate. Reasoning: Here b occurs before a, not after it, breaking the required order.\n\n\nPrecedence(a,b): b occurs only if preceded by a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The manufacturing line enables b (packaging) only after a sensor logs a (final assembly complete). Reasoning: The control logic keeps the packaging station disabled until the assembly-complete flag from a is present, so every time b runs an earlier a must already have finished.\n2. Within the insurance-claims app, b (payout) can be triggered solely when the system finds a prior a (manager approval) entry for that claim. Reasoning: The trigger condition for b is the existence of an approval record; consequently, whenever b happens the claim’s history necessarily contains a preceding a. \n3. The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete. Reasoning: The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-refund path, an agent can execute b (instant payout) with a supervisor override even when a (fraud check) has not been run. Reasoning: The override permits b to happen in runs where a never took place, so b is not guaranteed to be preceded by a.\n2. During a critical-outage hot-fix, engineers deploy the patch (b) first and run the automated test suite (a) only afterward if time allows. Reasoning: Here b occurs before or even without a, breaking the ‘preceded-by’ requirement.\n3. In urgent onboarding, IT provisions the account (b) while HR finishes creating the employee record (a) the next day. Reasoning: The provisioning action b can occur one or more days before a, contradicting the rule.\n\n\nCoExistence(a,b): a and b occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every new support case triggers a (open-ticket record) and, in the same transaction, auto-creates b (initial customer-reply template). Reasoning: The system executes a composite routine that writes both database rows atomically, so whenever a is logged b is logged too, and neither appears alone.\n2. For each vendor purchase, the ERP posts a (goods-received note) and simultaneously posts b (accounts-payable accrual) in the same commit. Reasoning: Posting logic is wrapped in a single database transaction—if either insert fails the whole transaction rolls back—therefore the system state contains both or neither.\n3. Publishing a news article executes a (content push to CDN) and b (metadata push to search index) as a locked job pair—neither job can be run in isolation. Reasoning: The deploy orchestrator groups them under one job ID; a switch disables standalone execution, guaranteeing paired occurrence.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. For micro-refunds, the agent can execute b (instant payout) while the fraud-check a is skipped. Reasoning: A valid path exists in which b occurs but a does not, so the pair does not always appear together.\n2. A legacy printer service fires b (shipping-label print) on address verification, but if inventory allocation a does not occur, the label still prints. Reasoning: The system can produce b even though a has not completed, so the two are not inseparable.\n3. When a student repeats a passed module, the registrar records a (module enrollment) but suppresses b (fee payment). Reasoning: This branch shows a without b, violating the rule.\n\n  \nNotCoExistence(a,b): a and b never occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. In the loan pipeline, low-risk applications flow through a (automatic approval) while high-risk ones are routed to b (manual committee review). Reasoning: The risk-based router selects exactly one mutually exclusive branch; a case flagged low-risk can never enter the high-risk branch and vice-versa, so no single run contains both a and b.\n2. At checkout a customer must choose either a (credit-card payment) or b (cash-on-delivery); the payment gateway disables the unselected option. Reasoning: The UI enforces a single-selection radio button and downstream code validates one—and only one—payment type, ensuring the two activities never co-appear in the same order.\n3. Regulations permit a sample to be processed via a (wet-lab chemical protocol) for liquid specimens or b (dry-lab bioinformatics) for genomic data, explicitly banning mixed handling. Reasoning: Compliance software validates specimen type before queuing the job and rejects any attempt to schedule the alternate protocol, so a single specimen workflow can contain only one of the two.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Borderline loan applications first undergo a (automated scoring) and then proceed to b (manual credit-committee review) before a decision is issued. Reasoning: A single borderline application clearly contains the sequence a → b, so both activities occur together.\n2. For VIP travel bookings, the system performs a (automatic ticket issuance) while simultaneously dispatching b (manual travel-agent confirmation) as an extra layer of service. Reasoning: Each VIP booking spawns both automated and manual tasks, so a and b co-exist in the same booking workflow.\n3. When a customer changes address on an open order, support runs a (address verification) and then launches b (fraud re-check) within the same service call. Reasoning: The single service request explicitly chains a and b together.\n\nNotSuccession(a,b): b cannot occur after a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The customer-complaint workflow finishes with a (final client sign-off); when that step is saved the ticket auto-closes, making b (internal escalation) impossible afterwards. Reasoning: Activity a terminates the case, so no subsequent task—including b—can be executed.\n2. During checkout, b (fraud screening) is run before payment capture, and once a (payment capture) succeeds the order is locked from further screening. Reasoning: b is always completed earlier in the timeline; after a, the lock prevents any new b event.\n3. In emergency releases, committing a (force merge to main) marks CI job b (code linting) as ‘skipped’ and locks the pipeline. Reasoning: The status change blocks b from running after the merge.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Auditors record a (preliminary sign-off) and then launch b (final compliance audit) to complete the dossier. Reasoning: The workflow explicitly places b after a, proving the forbidden order can occur.\n2. The emergency-release pipeline performs a (force deploy) and only afterwards runs b (post-deploy regression tests). Reasoning: A single deployment run contains a first and b later, so b follows a.\n3. The warehouse seals pallets with a (shipment sealing) and later performs b (random quality-inspection pulls) before loading the truck. Reasoning: Quality inspections b are scheduled chronologically after pallet sealing a.\n\nRespondedExistence(a,b): If a occurs in the trace, then b occurs as well. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Any training session that records a (hands-on lab) must also show b (theory module) on the same attendance sheet. Reasoning: The attendance sheet is invalid without entries for both modules; thus a session containing a always contains b, with order left to the organizer.\n2. Every incident record that contains a (temporary workaround) is required by policy to include b (permanent resolution) in the same incident file. Reasoning: The data model treats the pair as mandatory fields on the same record; whichever is entered first, the other must exist before closure, so any trace with a inevitably contains b, but timing is flexible.\n3. If a sprint backlog includes a (security epic), governance checks confirm that b (pen-test task) is also on the board. Reasoning: Board validation happens at sprint start and end, ensuring both items co-appear even though teams pick their own ordering.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the quick-refund lane, an agent can execute a (issue refund) and close the ticket, while b (root-cause investigation) is marked ‘optional’ and often skipped. Reasoning: A legitimate trace exists where a is present and b never appears, contradicting the implication.\n2. For VIP travelers, the airline auto-issues a (boarding pass) but waives b (secondary identity check) unless a random audit flag is raised. Reasoning: Many VIP traces show a without the corresponding b event.\n3. A late-stage sales opportunity logs a (verbal commitment) immediately, while b (formal contract upload) may be omitted if the deal falls through. Reasoning: When a deal collapses, the trace holds a but never records b.\n\nFor each task, I provide the set of activity labels that exist in the process.\n\n\nThe list of activities used in this process are the following.

The supported declarative constraint templates in our framework are:\n- AtMost1(a)\n- AtLeast1(a)\n- Response(a, b)\n- Precedence(a, b)\n- CoExistence(a, b)\n- NotCoExistence(a, b)\n- NotSuccession(a, b)\n- RespondedExistence(a, b)\n** Only use these templates. Do not invent new ones or use logical operators like “or”. **\n\n\nSome more instructions:\nIt is not possible to generate constraints like Response(a, (b or c)). The first and second elements must be a single activity\nIf several valid constraints refer to the same activities, keep only the most restrictive one. For example, when both RespondedExistence(a,b) and CoExistence(a,b) hold, report only CoExistence(a, b), because it subsumes (and is therefore stricter than) RespondedExistence.\n\n\nInteraction Protocol\nWhen you receive a new input:\n1) You may write reasoning steps (internally) before producing the JSON object — but never include them in the output.\n2) Once confident, generate and return the JSON object containing the constraints.\n3) Do not include explanation or commentary in the output.\n\n\nSome examples to learn the constraints and reasoning better:\nAtMost1(a): a occurs at most once. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Activity a may appear only as the final step of the project. Reasoning: Because a project has exactly one last step, a cannot be repeated.\n2. Completing activity a requires a single-use safety clearance that can be issued only once per project. Reasoning: Once the unique clearance is consumed, a second a cannot obtain it, so no second occurrence is legal.\n3. The project terminates immediately once activity a has been executed. Reasoning: Ending the schedule right after a leaves no remaining time slots in which another a could happen.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. The maintenance routine begins with a, proceeds through b and c, and then repeats a before concluding with d. Reasoning: a appears both at the start and again before the end—two occurrences.\n2. Every four-hour production cycle executes the sequence a, b, c; the plant runs three such cycles per day. Reasoning: Each cycle contains an a, so the day’s schedule contains a three separate times.\n3. The curriculum covers unit a in week 1 and revisits unit a for advanced exercises in week 4. Reasoning: The same activity a is taught twice in the single course timeline.\n\n\nAtLeast1(a): a occurs at least once, which means the existance of activity a is mandatory. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every case begins with activity a for baseline approval before any other work may proceed. Reasoning: The word “begins” makes a the very first step of every project run, guaranteeing one occurrence.\n2. In each instance, teams must perform activity a to certify the data set’s integrity. Reasoning: Filing the report is part of the process, and a is declared a mandatory predecessor, so at least one a precedes filing.\n3. Any customer-service ticket is automatically routed to a (triage) before it can enter the resolution queue. Reasoning: Since tickets must pass through the queue to be resolved, each ticket necessarily triggers one execution of a.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. When an order arrives with a pre-approved credit flag, the workflow jumps straight to b for planning and never calls a. Reasoning: The conditional branch bypasses a entirely whenever the flag is present, so some executions contain zero a’s.\n2. During off-season maintenance, technicians may optionally perform a or proceed directly to c if no calibration is needed. Reasoning: Because a is labeled ‘optional,’ a valid path exists in which the technicians skip it.\n3. A legacy integration still routes certain tickets directly to c, bypassing a and b altogether. Reasoning: Tickets entering through the legacy path never encounter a, violating the mandatory-presence requirement.\n\n\nResponse(a,b): If a occurs, then b occurs after a.\nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Each new client request triggers a for intake, followed immediately by b for verification before any other tasks may start. Reasoning: a is hard-coded to be immediately succeeded by b; no branch exists between them, so every time a appears, b necessarily follows.\n2. In the onboarding pipeline, once a (collecting identity documents) completes, the workflow engine automatically schedules b (identity validation) as the very next step. Reasoning: The engine inserts b right after a without user discretion, eliminating any path where a occurs and b does not.\n3. For every premium order, a (fraud screening) is executed and, upon success, the system proceeds to b (payment capture) before shipping. Reasoning: The success path from a programmatically advances to b; orders cannot ship (the process goal) until b completes, so a ➔ b is enforced.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-checkout flow, the system executes a (payment capture) and ships the order immediately, skipping the fraud-review step b.

During a critical-outage hot-fix, engineers deploy the patch (b) first and run the automated test suite (a) only afterward if time allows. Reasoning: Here b occurs before or even without a, breaking the ‘preceded-by’ requirement.\n3. In urgent onboarding, IT provisions the account (b) while HR finishes creating the employee record (a) the next day. Reasoning: The provisioning action b can occur one or more days before a, contradicting the rule.\n\n\nCoExistence(a,b): a and b occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every new support case triggers a (open-ticket record) and, in the same transaction, auto-creates b (initial customer-reply template). Reasoning: The system executes a composite routine that writes both database rows atomically, so whenever a is logged b is logged too, and neither appears alone.\n2. For each vendor purchase, the ERP posts a (goods-received note) and simultaneously posts b (accounts-payable accrual) in the same commit. Reasoning: Posting logic is wrapped in a single database transaction—if either insert fails the whole transaction rolls back—therefore the system state contains both or neither.\n3. Publishing a news article executes a (content push to CDN) and b (metadata push to search index) as a locked job pair—neither job can be run in isolation. Reasoning: The deploy orchestrator groups them under one job ID; a switch disables standalone execution, guaranteeing paired occurrence.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. For micro-refunds, the agent can execute b (instant payout) while the fraud-check a is skipped. Reasoning: A valid path exists in which b occurs but a does not, so the pair does not always appear together.\n2. A legacy printer service fires b (shipping-label print) on address verification, but if inventory allocation a does not occur, the label still prints. Reasoning: The system can produce b even though a has not completed, so the two are not inseparable.\n3. When a student repeats a passed module, the registrar records a (module enrollment) but suppresses b (fee payment). Reasoning: This branch shows a without b, violating the rule.\n\n  \nNotCoExistence(a,b): a and b never occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. In the loan pipeline, low-risk applications flow through a (automatic approval) while high-risk ones are routed to b (manual committee review). Reasoning: The risk-based router selects exactly one mutually exclusive branch; a case flagged low-risk can never enter the high-risk branch and vice-versa, so no single run contains both a and b.\n2. At checkout a customer must choose either a (credit-card payment) or b (cash-on-delivery); the payment gateway disables the unselected option. Reasoning: The UI enforces a single-selection radio button and downstream code validates one—and only one—payment type, ensuring the two activities never co-appear in the same order.\n3. Regulations permit a sample to be processed via a (wet-lab chemical protocol) for liquid specimens or b (dry-lab bioinformatics) for genomic data, explicitly banning mixed handling. Reasoning: Compliance software validates specimen type before queuing the job and rejects any attempt to schedule the alternate protocol, so a single specimen workflow can contain only one of the two.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Borderline loan applications first undergo a (automated scoring) and then proceed to b (manual credit-committee review) before a decision is issued. Reasoning: A single borderline application clearly contains the sequence a → b, so both activities occur together.\n2. For VIP travel bookings, the system performs a (automatic ticket issuance) while simultaneously dispatching b (manual travel-agent confirmation) as an extra layer of service. Reasoning: Each VIP booking spawns both automated and manual tasks, so a and b co-exist in the same booking workflow.\n3. When a customer changes address on an open order, support runs a (address verification) and then launches b (fraud re-check) within the same service call. Reasoning: The single service request explicitly chains a and b together.\n\nNotSuccession(a,b): b cannot occur after a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The customer-complaint workflow finishes with a (final client sign-off); when that step is saved the ticket auto-closes, making b (internal escalation) impossible afterwards. Reasoning: Activity a terminates the case, so no subsequent task—including b—can be executed.\n2. During checkout, b (fraud screening) is run before payment capture, and once a (payment capture) succeeds the order is locked from further screening. Reasoning: b is always completed earlier in the timeline; after a, the lock prevents any new b event.\n3. In emergency releases, committing a (force merge to main) marks CI job b (code linting) as ‘skipped’ and locks the pipeline. Reasoning: The status change blocks b from running after the merge.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Auditors record a (preliminary sign-off) and then launch b (final compliance audit) to complete the dossier. Reasoning: The workflow explicitly places b after a, proving the forbidden order can occur.\n2. The emergency-release pipeline performs a (force deploy) and only afterwards runs b (post-deploy regression tests). Reasoning: A single deployment run contains a first and b later, so b follows a.\n3. The warehouse seals pallets with a (shipment sealing) and later performs b (random quality-inspection pulls) before loading the truck. Reasoning: Quality inspections b are scheduled chronologically after pallet sealing a.\n\nRespondedExistence(a,b): If a occurs in the trace, then b occurs as well. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Any training session that records a (hands-on lab) must also show b (theory module) on the same attendance sheet. Reasoning: The attendance sheet is invalid without entries for both modules; thus a session containing a always contains b, with order left to the organizer.\n2. Every incident record that contains a (temporary workaround) is required by policy to include b (permanent resolution) in the same incident file. Reasoning: The data model treats the pair as mandatory fields on the same record; whichever is entered first, the other must exist before closure, so any trace with a inevitably contains b, but timing is flexible.\n3. If a sprint backlog includes a (security epic), governance checks confirm that b (pen-test task) is also on the board. Reasoning: Board validation happens at sprint start and end, ensuring both items co-appear even though teams pick their own ordering.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the quick-refund lane, an agent can execute a (issue refund) and close the ticket, while b (root-cause investigation) is marked ‘optional’ and often skipped. Reasoning: A legitimate trace exists where a is present and b never appears, contradicting the implication.\n2. For VIP travelers, the airline auto-issues a (boarding pass) but waives b (secondary identity check) unless a random audit flag is raised. Reasoning: Many VIP traces show a without the corresponding b event.\n3. A late-stage sales opportunity logs a (verbal commitment) immediately, while b (formal contract upload) may be omitted if the deal falls through. Reasoning: When a deal collapses, the trace holds a but never records b.\n\nFor each task, I provide the set of activity labels that exist in the process.\n\n\nThe list of activities used in this process are the following.

The supported declarative constraint templates in our framework are:\n- AtMost1(a)\n- AtLeast1(a)\n- Response(a, b)\n- Precedence(a, b)\n- CoExistence(a, b)\n- NotCoExistence(a, b)\n- NotSuccession(a, b)\n- RespondedExistence(a, b)\n** Only use these templates.

The first and second elements must be a single activity\nIf several valid constraints refer to the same activities, keep only the most restrictive one.

Activity a may appear only as the final step of the project. Reasoning: Because a project has exactly one last step, a cannot be repeated.\n2. Completing activity a requires a single-use safety clearance that can be issued only once per project. Reasoning: Once the unique clearance is consumed, a second a cannot obtain it, so no second occurrence is legal.\n3. The project terminates immediately once activity a has been executed. Reasoning: Ending the schedule right after a leaves no remaining time slots in which another a could happen.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. The maintenance routine begins with a, proceeds through b and c, and then repeats a before concluding with d. Reasoning: a appears both at the start and again before the end—two occurrences.\n2. Every four-hour production cycle executes the sequence a, b, c; the plant runs three such cycles per day. Reasoning: Each cycle contains an a, so the day’s schedule contains a three separate times.\n3. The curriculum covers unit a in week 1 and revisits unit a for advanced exercises in week 4. Reasoning: The same activity a is taught twice in the single course timeline.\n\n\nAtLeast1(a): a occurs at least once, which means the existance of activity a is mandatory. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every case begins with activity a for baseline approval before any other work may proceed. Reasoning: The word “begins” makes a the very first step of every project run, guaranteeing one occurrence.\n2. In each instance, teams must perform activity a to certify the data set’s integrity. Reasoning: Filing the report is part of the process, and a is declared a mandatory predecessor, so at least one a precedes filing.\n3. Any customer-service ticket is automatically routed to a (triage) before it can enter the resolution queue. Reasoning: Since tickets must pass through the queue to be resolved, each ticket necessarily triggers one execution of a.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. When an order arrives with a pre-approved credit flag, the workflow jumps straight to b for planning and never calls a. Reasoning: The conditional branch bypasses a entirely whenever the flag is present, so some executions contain zero a’s.\n2. During off-season maintenance, technicians may optionally perform a or proceed directly to c if no calibration is needed. Reasoning: Because a is labeled ‘optional,’ a valid path exists in which the technicians skip it.\n3. A legacy integration still routes certain tickets directly to c, bypassing a and b altogether. Reasoning: Tickets entering through the legacy path never encounter a, violating the mandatory-presence requirement.\n\n\nResponse(a,b): If a occurs, then b occurs after a.\nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Each new client request triggers a for intake, followed immediately by b for verification before any other tasks may start. Reasoning: a is hard-coded to be immediately succeeded by b; no branch exists between them, so every time a appears, b necessarily follows.\n2. In the onboarding pipeline, once a (collecting identity documents) completes, the workflow engine automatically schedules b (identity validation) as the very next step. Reasoning: The engine inserts b right after a without user discretion, eliminating any path where a occurs and b does not.\n3. For every premium order, a (fraud screening) is executed and, upon success, the system proceeds to b (payment capture) before shipping. Reasoning: The success path from a programmatically advances to b; orders cannot ship (the process goal) until b completes, so a ➔ b is enforced.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-checkout flow, the system executes a (payment capture) and ships the order immediately, skipping the fraud-review step b. Reasoning: A occurs, but b never happens, so the implication fails.\n2. During a critical-outage fix, engineers apply a (hot patch) and close the incident log without performing the normal post-patch verification b. Reasoning: The emergency path lets the process end with a but without a subsequent b.\n3. For VIP passengers, security screening b is completed pre-flight, and if an ID issue arises later, staff perform a secondary identity swipe a right at the gate. Reasoning: Here b occurs before a, not after it, breaking the required order.\n\n\nPrecedence(a,b): b occurs only if preceded by a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The manufacturing line enables b (packaging) only after a sensor logs a (final assembly complete). Reasoning: The control logic keeps the packaging station disabled until the assembly-complete flag from a is present, so every time b runs an earlier a must already have finished.\n2. Within the insurance-claims app, b (payout) can be triggered solely when the system finds a prior a (manager approval) entry for that claim. Reasoning: The trigger condition for b is the existence of an approval record; consequently, whenever b happens the claim’s history necessarily contains a preceding a. \n3. The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete. Reasoning: The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-refund path, an agent can execute b (instant payout) with a supervisor override even when a (fraud check) has not been run.

Reasoning: The risk-based router selects exactly one mutually exclusive branch; a case flagged low-risk can never enter the high-risk branch and vice-versa, so no single run contains both a and b.\n2. At checkout a customer must choose either a (credit-card payment) or b (cash-on-delivery); the payment gateway disables the unselected option. Reasoning: The UI enforces a single-selection radio button and downstream code validates one—and only one—payment type, ensuring the two activities never co-appear in the same order.\n3. Regulations permit a sample to be processed via a (wet-lab chemical protocol) for liquid specimens or b (dry-lab bioinformatics) for genomic data, explicitly banning mixed handling. Reasoning: Compliance software validates specimen type before queuing the job and rejects any attempt to schedule the alternate protocol, so a single specimen workflow can contain only one of the two.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Borderline loan applications first undergo a (automated scoring) and then proceed to b (manual credit-committee review) before a decision is issued. Reasoning: A single borderline application clearly contains the sequence a → b, so both activities occur together.\n2. For VIP travel bookings, the system performs a (automatic ticket issuance) while simultaneously dispatching b (manual travel-agent confirmation) as an extra layer of service. Reasoning: Each VIP booking spawns both automated and manual tasks, so a and b co-exist in the same booking workflow.\n3. When a customer changes address on an open order, support runs a (address verification) and then launches b (fraud re-check) within the same service call. Reasoning: The single service request explicitly chains a and b together.\n\nNotSuccession(a,b): b cannot occur after a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The customer-complaint workflow finishes with a (final client sign-off); when that step is saved the ticket auto-closes, making b (internal escalation) impossible afterwards. Reasoning: Activity a terminates the case, so no subsequent task—including b—can be executed.\n2. During checkout, b (fraud screening) is run before payment capture, and once a (payment capture) succeeds the order is locked from further screening. Reasoning: b is always completed earlier in the timeline; after a, the lock prevents any new b event.\n3. In emergency releases, committing a (force merge to main) marks CI job b (code linting) as ‘skipped’ and locks the pipeline. Reasoning: The status change blocks b from running after the merge.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Auditors record a (preliminary sign-off) and then launch b (final compliance audit) to complete the dossier. Reasoning: The workflow explicitly places b after a, proving the forbidden order can occur.\n2. The emergency-release pipeline performs a (force deploy) and only afterwards runs b (post-deploy regression tests). Reasoning: A single deployment run contains a first and b later, so b follows a.\n3. The warehouse seals pallets with a (shipment sealing) and later performs b (random quality-inspection pulls) before loading the truck. Reasoning: Quality inspections b are scheduled chronologically after pallet sealing a.\n\nRespondedExistence(a,b): If a occurs in the trace, then b occurs as well. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Any training session that records a (hands-on lab) must also show b (theory module) on the same attendance sheet. Reasoning: The attendance sheet is invalid without entries for both modules; thus a session containing a always contains b, with order left to the organizer.\n2. Every incident record that contains a (temporary workaround) is required by policy to include b (permanent resolution) in the same incident file. Reasoning: The data model treats the pair as mandatory fields on the same record; whichever is entered first, the other must exist before closure, so any trace with a inevitably contains b, but timing is flexible.\n3. If a sprint backlog includes a (security epic), governance checks confirm that b (pen-test task) is also on the board. Reasoning: Board validation happens at sprint start and end, ensuring both items co-appear even though teams pick their own ordering.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the quick-refund lane, an agent can execute a (issue refund) and close the ticket, while b (root-cause investigation) is marked ‘optional’ and often skipped. Reasoning: A legitimate trace exists where a is present and b never appears, contradicting the implication.\n2. For VIP travelers, the airline auto-issues a (boarding pass) but waives b (secondary identity check) unless a random audit flag is raised. Reasoning: Many VIP traces show a without the corresponding b event.\n3. A late-stage sales opportunity logs a (verbal commitment) immediately, while b (formal contract upload) may be omitted if the deal falls through. Reasoning: When a deal collapses, the trace holds a but never records b.\n\nFor each task, I provide the set of activity labels that exist in the process.\n\n\nThe list of activities used in this process are the following.

Only return a single valid JSON object exactly like this.**\n{\n  \"constraints\": [\n    {\n      \"template\": \"Response\",\n      \"parameters\": [[\"a\"], [\"b\"]]\n    },\n    {\n      \"template\": \"AtMost1\",\n      \"parameters\": [[\"c\"]]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nSupported Templates:\nConsider only the following declarative constraint definitions where a, b, c, and d are activities and template example-template(x,y) specifies a template named \"example-template\" and x and y can be one of the activities from the set of all activities. The supported declarative constraint templates in our framework are:\n- AtMost1(a)\n- AtLeast1(a)\n- Response(a, b)\n- Precedence(a, b)\n- CoExistence(a, b)\n- NotCoExistence(a, b)\n- NotSuccession(a, b)\n- RespondedExistence(a, b)\n** Only use these templates.

The first and second elements must be a single activity\nIf several valid constraints refer to the same activities, keep only the most restrictive one. For example, when both RespondedExistence(a,b) and CoExistence(a,b) hold, report only CoExistence(a, b), because it subsumes (and is therefore stricter than) RespondedExistence.\n\n\nInteraction Protocol\nWhen you receive a new input:\n1) You may write reasoning steps (internally) before producing the JSON object — but never include them in the output.\n2) Once confident, generate and return the JSON object containing the constraints.\n3) Do not include explanation or commentary in the output.\n\n\nSome examples to learn the constraints and reasoning better:\nAtMost1(a): a occurs at most once. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Activity a may appear only as the final step of the project. Reasoning: Because a project has exactly one last step, a cannot be repeated.\n2. Completing activity a requires a single-use safety clearance that can be issued only once per project. Reasoning: Once the unique clearance is consumed, a second a cannot obtain it, so no second occurrence is legal.\n3. The project terminates immediately once activity a has been executed. Reasoning: Ending the schedule right after a leaves no remaining time slots in which another a could happen.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. The maintenance routine begins with a, proceeds through b and c, and then repeats a before concluding with d. Reasoning: a appears both at the start and again before the end—two occurrences.\n2. Every four-hour production cycle executes the sequence a, b, c; the plant runs three such cycles per day. Reasoning: Each cycle contains an a, so the day’s schedule contains a three separate times.\n3. The curriculum covers unit a in week 1 and revisits unit a for advanced exercises in week 4. Reasoning: The same activity a is taught twice in the single course timeline.\n\n\nAtLeast1(a): a occurs at least once, which means the existance of activity a is mandatory. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every case begins with activity a for baseline approval before any other work may proceed. Reasoning: The word “begins” makes a the very first step of every project run, guaranteeing one occurrence.\n2. In each instance, teams must perform activity a to certify the data set’s integrity. Reasoning: Filing the report is part of the process, and a is declared a mandatory predecessor, so at least one a precedes filing.\n3. Any customer-service ticket is automatically routed to a (triage) before it can enter the resolution queue. Reasoning: Since tickets must pass through the queue to be resolved, each ticket necessarily triggers one execution of a.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. When an order arrives with a pre-approved credit flag, the workflow jumps straight to b for planning and never calls a. Reasoning: The conditional branch bypasses a entirely whenever the flag is present, so some executions contain zero a’s.\n2. During off-season maintenance, technicians may optionally perform a or proceed directly to c if no calibration is needed. Reasoning: Because a is labeled ‘optional,’ a valid path exists in which the technicians skip it.\n3. A legacy integration still routes certain tickets directly to c, bypassing a and b altogether. Reasoning: Tickets entering through the legacy path never encounter a, violating the mandatory-presence requirement.\n\n\nResponse(a,b): If a occurs, then b occurs after a.\nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Each new client request triggers a for intake, followed immediately by b for verification before any other tasks may start. Reasoning: a is hard-coded to be immediately succeeded by b; no branch exists between them, so every time a appears, b necessarily follows.\n2. In the onboarding pipeline, once a (collecting identity documents) completes, the workflow engine automatically schedules b (identity validation) as the very next step. Reasoning: The engine inserts b right after a without user discretion, eliminating any path where a occurs and b does not.\n3. For every premium order, a (fraud screening) is executed and, upon success, the system proceeds to b (payment capture) before shipping. Reasoning: The success path from a programmatically advances to b; orders cannot ship (the process goal) until b completes, so a ➔ b is enforced.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-checkout flow, the system executes a (payment capture) and ships the order immediately, skipping the fraud-review step b. Reasoning: A occurs, but b never happens, so the implication fails.\n2. During a critical-outage fix, engineers apply a (hot patch) and close the incident log without performing the normal post-patch verification b. Reasoning: The emergency path lets the process end with a but without a subsequent b.\n3. For VIP passengers, security screening b is completed pre-flight, and if an ID issue arises later, staff perform a secondary identity swipe a right at the gate. Reasoning: Here b occurs before a, not after it, breaking the required order.\n\n\nPrecedence(a,b): b occurs only if preceded by a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The manufacturing line enables b (packaging) only after a sensor logs a (final assembly complete). Reasoning: The control logic keeps the packaging station disabled until the assembly-complete flag from a is present, so every time b runs an earlier a must already have finished.\n2. Within the insurance-claims app, b (payout) can be triggered solely when the system finds a prior a (manager approval) entry for that claim. Reasoning: The trigger condition for b is the existence of an approval record; consequently, whenever b happens the claim’s history necessarily contains a preceding a. \n3. The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete. Reasoning: The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-refund path, an agent can execute b (instant payout) with a supervisor override even when a (fraud check) has not been run. Reasoning: The override permits b to happen in runs where a never took place, so b is not guaranteed to be preceded by a.\n2. During a critical-outage hot-fix, engineers deploy the patch (b) first and run the automated test suite (a) only afterward if time allows. Reasoning: Here b occurs before or even without a, breaking the ‘preceded-by’ requirement.\n3. In urgent onboarding, IT provisions the account (b) while HR finishes creating the employee record (a) the next day. Reasoning: The provisioning action b can occur one or more days before a, contradicting the rule.\n\n\nCoExistence(a,b): a and b occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every new support case triggers a (open-ticket record) and, in the same transaction, auto-creates b (initial customer-reply template). Reasoning: The system executes a composite routine that writes both database rows atomically, so whenever a is logged b is logged too, and neither appears alone.\n2. For each vendor purchase, the ERP posts a (goods-received note) and simultaneously posts b (accounts-payable accrual) in the same commit. Reasoning: Posting logic is wrapped in a single database transaction—if either insert fails the whole transaction rolls back—therefore the system state contains both or neither.\n3. Publishing a news article executes a (content push to CDN) and b (metadata push to search index) as a locked job pair—neither job can be run in isolation. Reasoning: The deploy orchestrator groups them under one job ID; a switch disables standalone execution, guaranteeing paired occurrence.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. For micro-refunds, the agent can execute b (instant payout) while the fraud-check a is skipped. Reasoning: A valid path exists in which b occurs but a does not, so the pair does not always appear together.\n2. A legacy printer service fires b (shipping-label print) on address verification, but if inventory allocation a does not occur, the label still prints. Reasoning: The system can produce b even though a has not completed, so the two are not inseparable.\n3. When a student repeats a passed module, the registrar records a (module enrollment) but suppresses b (fee payment). Reasoning: This branch shows a without b, violating the rule.\n\n  \nNotCoExistence(a,b): a and b never occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1.

Reasoning: Activity a terminates the case, so no subsequent task—including b—can be executed.\n2. During checkout, b (fraud screening) is run before payment capture, and once a (payment capture) succeeds the order is locked from further screening. Reasoning: b is always completed earlier in the timeline; after a, the lock prevents any new b event.\n3. In emergency releases, committing a (force merge to main) marks CI job b (code linting) as ‘skipped’ and locks the pipeline. Reasoning: The status change blocks b from running after the merge.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Auditors record a (preliminary sign-off) and then launch b (final compliance audit) to complete the dossier. Reasoning: The workflow explicitly places b after a, proving the forbidden order can occur.\n2. The emergency-release pipeline performs a (force deploy) and only afterwards runs b (post-deploy regression tests). Reasoning: A single deployment run contains a first and b later, so b follows a.\n3. The warehouse seals pallets with a (shipment sealing) and later performs b (random quality-inspection pulls) before loading the truck. Reasoning: Quality inspections b are scheduled chronologically after pallet sealing a.\n\nRespondedExistence(a,b): If a occurs in the trace, then b occurs as well. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Any training session that records a (hands-on lab) must also show b (theory module) on the same attendance sheet. Reasoning: The attendance sheet is invalid without entries for both modules; thus a session containing a always contains b, with order left to the organizer.\n2. Every incident record that contains a (temporary workaround) is required by policy to include b (permanent resolution) in the same incident file. Reasoning: The data model treats the pair as mandatory fields on the same record; whichever is entered first, the other must exist before closure, so any trace with a inevitably contains b, but timing is flexible.\n3. If a sprint backlog includes a (security epic), governance checks confirm that b (pen-test task) is also on the board. Reasoning: Board validation happens at sprint start and end, ensuring both items co-appear even though teams pick their own ordering.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the quick-refund lane, an agent can execute a (issue refund) and close the ticket, while b (root-cause investigation) is marked ‘optional’ and often skipped. Reasoning: A legitimate trace exists where a is present and b never appears, contradicting the implication.\n2. For VIP travelers, the airline auto-issues a (boarding pass) but waives b (secondary identity check) unless a random audit flag is raised. Reasoning: Many VIP traces show a without the corresponding b event.\n3. A late-stage sales opportunity logs a (verbal commitment) immediately, while b (formal contract upload) may be omitted if the deal falls through. Reasoning: When a deal collapses, the trace holds a but never records b.\n\nFor each task, I provide the set of activity labels that exist in the process.\n\n\nThe list of activities used in this process are the following.

The supported declarative constraint templates in our framework are:\n- AtMost1(a)\n- AtLeast1(a)\n- Response(a, b)\n- Precedence(a, b)\n- CoExistence(a, b)\n- NotCoExistence(a, b)\n- NotSuccession(a, b)\n- RespondedExistence(a, b)\n** Only use these templates.

The first and second elements must be a single activity\nIf several valid constraints refer to the same activities, keep only the most restrictive one.

Activity a may appear only as the final step of the project. Reasoning: Because a project has exactly one last step, a cannot be repeated.\n2. Completing activity a requires a single-use safety clearance that can be issued only once per project. Reasoning: Once the unique clearance is consumed, a second a cannot obtain it, so no second occurrence is legal.\n3. The project terminates immediately once activity a has been executed. Reasoning: Ending the schedule right after a leaves no remaining time slots in which another a could happen.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. The maintenance routine begins with a, proceeds through b and c, and then repeats a before concluding with d. Reasoning: a appears both at the start and again before the end—two occurrences.\n2. Every four-hour production cycle executes the sequence a, b, c; the plant runs three such cycles per day. Reasoning: Each cycle contains an a, so the day’s schedule contains a three separate times.\n3. The curriculum covers unit a in week 1 and revisits unit a for advanced exercises in week 4. Reasoning: The same activity a is taught twice in the single course timeline.\n\n\nAtLeast1(a): a occurs at least once, which means the existance of activity a is mandatory. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every case begins with activity a for baseline approval before any other work may proceed. Reasoning: The word “begins” makes a the very first step of every project run, guaranteeing one occurrence.\n2. In each instance, teams must perform activity a to certify the data set’s integrity. Reasoning: Filing the report is part of the process, and a is declared a mandatory predecessor, so at least one a precedes filing.\n3. Any customer-service ticket is automatically routed to a (triage) before it can enter the resolution queue. Reasoning: Since tickets must pass through the queue to be resolved, each ticket necessarily triggers one execution of a.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. When an order arrives with a pre-approved credit flag, the workflow jumps straight to b for planning and never calls a. Reasoning: The conditional branch bypasses a entirely whenever the flag is present, so some executions contain zero a’s.\n2. During off-season maintenance, technicians may optionally perform a or proceed directly to c if no calibration is needed. Reasoning: Because a is labeled ‘optional,’ a valid path exists in which the technicians skip it.\n3. A legacy integration still routes certain tickets directly to c, bypassing a and b altogether. Reasoning: Tickets entering through the legacy path never encounter a, violating the mandatory-presence requirement.\n\n\nResponse(a,b): If a occurs, then b occurs after a.\nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Each new client request triggers a for intake, followed immediately by b for verification before any other tasks may start. Reasoning: a is hard-coded to be immediately succeeded by b; no branch exists between them, so every time a appears, b necessarily follows.\n2. In the onboarding pipeline, once a (collecting identity documents) completes, the workflow engine automatically schedules b (identity validation) as the very next step. Reasoning: The engine inserts b right after a without user discretion, eliminating any path where a occurs and b does not.\n3. For every premium order, a (fraud screening) is executed and, upon success, the system proceeds to b (payment capture) before shipping. Reasoning: The success path from a programmatically advances to b; orders cannot ship (the process goal) until b completes, so a ➔ b is enforced.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-checkout flow, the system executes a (payment capture) and ships the order immediately, skipping the fraud-review step b. Reasoning: A occurs, but b never happens, so the implication fails.\n2. During a critical-outage fix, engineers apply a (hot patch) and close the incident log without performing the normal post-patch verification b. Reasoning: The emergency path lets the process end with a but without a subsequent b.\n3. For VIP passengers, security screening b is completed pre-flight, and if an ID issue arises later, staff perform a secondary identity swipe a right at the gate. Reasoning: Here b occurs before a, not after it, breaking the required order.\n\n\nPrecedence(a,b): b occurs only if preceded by a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The manufacturing line enables b (packaging) only after a sensor logs a (final assembly complete). Reasoning: The control logic keeps the packaging station disabled until the assembly-complete flag from a is present, so every time b runs an earlier a must already have finished.\n2. Within the insurance-claims app, b (payout) can be triggered solely when the system finds a prior a (manager approval) entry for that claim. Reasoning: The trigger condition for b is the existence of an approval record; consequently, whenever b happens the claim’s history necessarily contains a preceding a. \n3. The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete. Reasoning: The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-refund path, an agent can execute b (instant payout) with a supervisor override even when a (fraud check) has not been run. Reasoning: The override permits b to happen in runs where a never took place, so b is not guaranteed to be preceded by a.\n2. During a critical-outage hot-fix, engineers deploy the patch (b) first and run the automated test suite (a) only afterward if time allows. Reasoning: Here b occurs before or even without a, breaking the ‘preceded-by’ requirement.\n3. In urgent onboarding, IT provisions the account (b) while HR finishes creating the employee record (a) the next day. Reasoning: The provisioning action b can occur one or more days before a, contradicting the rule.\n\n\nCoExistence(a,b): a and b occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every new support case triggers a (open-ticket record) and, in the same transaction, auto-creates b (initial customer-reply template). Reasoning: The system executes a composite routine that writes both database rows atomically, so whenever a is logged b is logged too, and neither appears alone.\n2. For each vendor purchase, the ERP posts a (goods-received note) and simultaneously posts b (accounts-payable accrual) in the same commit. Reasoning: Posting logic is wrapped in a single database transaction—if either insert fails the whole transaction rolls back—therefore the system state contains both or neither.\n3. Publishing a news article executes a (content push to CDN) and b (metadata push to search index) as a locked job pair—neither job can be run in isolation. Reasoning: The deploy orchestrator groups them under one job ID; a switch disables standalone execution, guaranteeing paired occurrence.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. For micro-refunds, the agent can execute b (instant payout) while the fraud-check a is skipped. Reasoning: A valid path exists in which b occurs but a does not, so the pair does not always appear together.\n2. A legacy printer service fires b (shipping-label print) on address verification, but if inventory allocation a does not occur, the label still prints. Reasoning: The system can produce b even though a has not completed, so the two are not inseparable.\n3. When a student repeats a passed module, the registrar records a (module enrollment) but suppresses b (fee payment). Reasoning: This branch shows a without b, violating the rule.\n\n  \nNotCoExistence(a,b): a and b never occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. In the loan pipeline, low-risk applications flow through a (automatic approval) while high-risk ones are routed to b (manual committee review). Reasoning: The risk-based router selects exactly one mutually exclusive branch; a case flagged low-risk can never enter the high-risk branch and vice-versa, so no single run contains both a and b.\n2. At checkout a customer must choose either a (credit-card payment) or b (cash-on-delivery); the payment gateway disables the unselected option. Reasoning: The UI enforces a single-selection radio button and downstream code validates one—and only one—payment type, ensuring the two activities never co-appear in the same order.\n3. Regulations permit a sample to be processed via a (wet-lab chemical protocol) for liquid specimens or b (dry-lab bioinformatics) for genomic data, explicitly banning mixed handling. Reasoning: Compliance software validates specimen type before queuing the job and rejects any attempt to schedule the alternate protocol, so a single specimen workflow can contain only one of the two.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Borderline loan applications first undergo a (automated scoring) and then proceed to b (manual credit-committee review) before a decision is issued. Reasoning: A single borderline application clearly contains the sequence a → b, so both activities occur together.\n2. For VIP travel bookings, the system performs a (automatic ticket issuance) while simultaneously dispatching b (manual travel-agent confirmation) as an extra layer of service. Reasoning: Each VIP booking spawns both automated and manual tasks, so a and b co-exist in the same booking workflow.\n3. When a customer changes address on an open order, support runs a (address verification) and then launches b (fraud re-check) within the same service call. Reasoning: The single service request explicitly chains a and b together.\n\nNotSuccession(a,b): b cannot occur after a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1.

The supported declarative constraint templates in our framework are:\n- AtMost1(a)\n- AtLeast1(a)\n- Response(a, b)\n- Precedence(a, b)\n- CoExistence(a, b)\n- NotCoExistence(a, b)\n- NotSuccession(a, b)\n- RespondedExistence(a, b)\n** Only use these templates.

The first and second elements must be a single activity\nIf several valid constraints refer to the same activities, keep only the most restrictive one. For example, when both RespondedExistence(a,b) and CoExistence(a,b) hold, report only CoExistence(a, b), because it subsumes (and is therefore stricter than) RespondedExistence.\n\n\nInteraction Protocol\nWhen you receive a new input:\n1) You may write reasoning steps (internally) before producing the JSON object — but never include them in the output.\n2) Once confident, generate and return the JSON object containing the constraints.\n3) Do not include explanation or commentary in the output.\n\n\nSome examples to learn the constraints and reasoning better:\nAtMost1(a): a occurs at most once. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Activity a may appear only as the final step of the project. Reasoning: Because a project has exactly one last step, a cannot be repeated.\n2. Completing activity a requires a single-use safety clearance that can be issued only once per project. Reasoning: Once the unique clearance is consumed, a second a cannot obtain it, so no second occurrence is legal.\n3. The project terminates immediately once activity a has been executed. Reasoning: Ending the schedule right after a leaves no remaining time slots in which another a could happen.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. The maintenance routine begins with a, proceeds through b and c, and then repeats a before concluding with d. Reasoning: a appears both at the start and again before the end—two occurrences.\n2. Every four-hour production cycle executes the sequence a, b, c; the plant runs three such cycles per day. Reasoning: Each cycle contains an a, so the day’s schedule contains a three separate times.\n3. The curriculum covers unit a in week 1 and revisits unit a for advanced exercises in week 4. Reasoning: The same activity a is taught twice in the single course timeline.\n\n\nAtLeast1(a): a occurs at least once, which means the existance of activity a is mandatory. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every case begins with activity a for baseline approval before any other work may proceed. Reasoning: The word “begins” makes a the very first step of every project run, guaranteeing one occurrence.\n2. In each instance, teams must perform activity a to certify the data set’s integrity. Reasoning: Filing the report is part of the process, and a is declared a mandatory predecessor, so at least one a precedes filing.\n3. Any customer-service ticket is automatically routed to a (triage) before it can enter the resolution queue. Reasoning: Since tickets must pass through the queue to be resolved, each ticket necessarily triggers one execution of a.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. When an order arrives with a pre-approved credit flag, the workflow jumps straight to b for planning and never calls a. Reasoning: The conditional branch bypasses a entirely whenever the flag is present, so some executions contain zero a’s.\n2. During off-season maintenance, technicians may optionally perform a or proceed directly to c if no calibration is needed. Reasoning: Because a is labeled ‘optional,’ a valid path exists in which the technicians skip it.\n3. A legacy integration still routes certain tickets directly to c, bypassing a and b altogether. Reasoning: Tickets entering through the legacy path never encounter a, violating the mandatory-presence requirement.\n\n\nResponse(a,b): If a occurs, then b occurs after a.\nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Each new client request triggers a for intake, followed immediately by b for verification before any other tasks may start. Reasoning: a is hard-coded to be immediately succeeded by b; no branch exists between them, so every time a appears, b necessarily follows.\n2. In the onboarding pipeline, once a (collecting identity documents) completes, the workflow engine automatically schedules b (identity validation) as the very next step. Reasoning: The engine inserts b right after a without user discretion, eliminating any path where a occurs and b does not.\n3. For every premium order, a (fraud screening) is executed and, upon success, the system proceeds to b (payment capture) before shipping. Reasoning: The success path from a programmatically advances to b; orders cannot ship (the process goal) until b completes, so a ➔ b is enforced.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-checkout flow, the system executes a (payment capture) and ships the order immediately, skipping the fraud-review step b. Reasoning: A occurs, but b never happens, so the implication fails.\n2. During a critical-outage fix, engineers apply a (hot patch) and close the incident log without performing the normal post-patch verification b. Reasoning: The emergency path lets the process end with a but without a subsequent b.\n3. For VIP passengers, security screening b is completed pre-flight, and if an ID issue arises later, staff perform a secondary identity swipe a right at the gate. Reasoning: Here b occurs before a, not after it, breaking the required order.\n\n\nPrecedence(a,b): b occurs only if preceded by a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The manufacturing line enables b (packaging) only after a sensor logs a (final assembly complete). Reasoning: The control logic keeps the packaging station disabled until the assembly-complete flag from a is present, so every time b runs an earlier a must already have finished.\n2. Within the insurance-claims app, b (payout) can be triggered solely when the system finds a prior a (manager approval) entry for that claim. Reasoning: The trigger condition for b is the existence of an approval record; consequently, whenever b happens the claim’s history necessarily contains a preceding a. \n3. The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete. Reasoning: The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-refund path, an agent can execute b (instant payout) with a supervisor override even when a (fraud check) has not been run. Reasoning: The override permits b to happen in runs where a never took place, so b is not guaranteed to be preceded by a.\n2. During a critical-outage hot-fix, engineers deploy the patch (b) first and run the automated test suite (a) only afterward if time allows. Reasoning: Here b occurs before or even without a, breaking the ‘preceded-by’ requirement.\n3. In urgent onboarding, IT provisions the account (b) while HR finishes creating the employee record (a) the next day. Reasoning: The provisioning action b can occur one or more days before a, contradicting the rule.\n\n\nCoExistence(a,b): a and b occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every new support case triggers a (open-ticket record) and, in the same transaction, auto-creates b (initial customer-reply template). Reasoning: The system executes a composite routine that writes both database rows atomically, so whenever a is logged b is logged too, and neither appears alone.\n2. For each vendor purchase, the ERP posts a (goods-received note) and simultaneously posts b (accounts-payable accrual) in the same commit. Reasoning: Posting logic is wrapped in a single database transaction—if either insert fails the whole transaction rolls back—therefore the system state contains both or neither.\n3. Publishing a news article executes a (content push to CDN) and b (metadata push to search index) as a locked job pair—neither job can be run in isolation. Reasoning: The deploy orchestrator groups them under one job ID; a switch disables standalone execution, guaranteeing paired occurrence.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. For micro-refunds, the agent can execute b (instant payout) while the fraud-check a is skipped. Reasoning: A valid path exists in which b occurs but a does not, so the pair does not always appear together.\n2. A legacy printer service fires b (shipping-label print) on address verification, but if inventory allocation a does not occur, the label still prints. Reasoning: The system can produce b even though a has not completed, so the two are not inseparable.\n3. When a student repeats a passed module, the registrar records a (module enrollment) but suppresses b (fee payment). Reasoning: This branch shows a without b, violating the rule.\n\n  \nNotCoExistence(a,b): a and b never occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. In the loan pipeline, low-risk applications flow through a (automatic approval) while high-risk ones are routed to b (manual committee review). Reasoning: The risk-based router selects exactly one mutually exclusive branch; a case flagged low-risk can never enter the high-risk branch and vice-versa, so no single run contains both a and b.\n2. At checkout a customer must choose either a (credit-card payment) or b (cash-on-delivery); the payment gateway disables the unselected option. Reasoning: The UI enforces a single-selection radio button and downstream code validates one—and only one—payment type, ensuring the two activities never co-appear in the same order.\n3. Regulations permit a sample to be processed via a (wet-lab chemical protocol) for liquid specimens or b (dry-lab bioinformatics) for genomic data, explicitly banning mixed handling. Reasoning: Compliance software validates specimen type before queuing the job and rejects any attempt to schedule the alternate protocol, so a single specimen workflow can contain only one of the two.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Borderline loan applications first undergo a (automated scoring) and then proceed to b (manual credit-committee review) before a decision is issued. Reasoning: A single borderline application clearly contains the sequence a → b, so both activities occur together.\n2. For VIP travel bookings, the system performs a (automatic ticket issuance) while simultaneously dispatching b (manual travel-agent confirmation) as an extra layer of service. Reasoning: Each VIP booking spawns both automated and manual tasks, so a and b co-exist in the same booking workflow.\n3. When a customer changes address on an open order, support runs a (address verification) and then launches b (fraud re-check) within the same service call. Reasoning: The single service request explicitly chains a and b together.\n\nNotSuccession(a,b): b cannot occur after a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The customer-complaint workflow finishes with a (final client sign-off); when that step is saved the ticket auto-closes, making b (internal escalation) impossible afterwards. Reasoning: Activity a terminates the case, so no subsequent task—including b—can be executed.\n2. During checkout, b (fraud screening) is run before payment capture, and once a (payment capture) succeeds the order is locked from further screening. Reasoning: b is always completed earlier in the timeline; after a, the lock prevents any new b event.\n3. In emergency releases, committing a (force merge to main) marks CI job b (code linting) as ‘skipped’ and locks the pipeline. Reasoning: The status change blocks b from running after the merge.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Auditors record a (preliminary sign-off) and then launch b (final compliance audit) to complete the dossier. Reasoning: The workflow explicitly places b after a, proving the forbidden order can occur.\n2. The emergency-release pipeline performs a (force deploy) and only afterwards runs b (post-deploy regression tests). Reasoning: A single deployment run contains a first and b later, so b follows a.\n3. The warehouse seals pallets with a (shipment sealing) and later performs b (random quality-inspection pulls) before loading the truck. Reasoning: Quality inspections b are scheduled chronologically after pallet sealing a.\n\nRespondedExistence(a,b): If a occurs in the trace, then b occurs as well. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Any training session that records a (hands-on lab) must also show b (theory module) on the same attendance sheet. Reasoning: The attendance sheet is invalid without entries for both modules; thus a session containing a always contains b, with order left to the organizer.\n2. Every incident record that contains a (temporary workaround) is required by policy to include b (permanent resolution) in the same incident file. Reasoning: The data model treats the pair as mandatory fields on the same record; whichever is entered first, the other must exist before closure, so any trace with a inevitably contains b, but timing is flexible.\n3. If a sprint backlog includes a (security epic), governance checks confirm that b (pen-test task) is also on the board. Reasoning: Board validation happens at sprint start and end, ensuring both items co-appear even though teams pick their own ordering.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the quick-refund lane, an agent can execute a (issue refund) and close the ticket, while b (root-cause investigation) is marked ‘optional’ and often skipped.

    "full_prompt": "Task Overview:\nYou are an assistant that helps translate free-text process descriptions into declarative process constraints.\n\nYour goal is to:\n1) Identify declarative constraints from the text.\n2) Return them in strict JSON format (see below).\n\nJSON Output Format:\nYou must always return a single valid JSON object in this format:\n** Do not return any explanation or markdown. Only return a single valid JSON object exactly like this.**\n{\n  \"constraints\": [\n    {\n      \"template\": \"Response\",\n      \"parameters\": [[\"a\"], [\"b\"]]\n    },\n    {\n      \"template\": \"AtMost1\",\n      \"parameters\": [[\"c\"]]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nSupported Templates:\nConsider only the following declarative constraint definitions where a, b, c, and d are activities and template example-template(x,y) specifies a template named \"example-template\" and x and y can be one of the activities from the set of all activities. The supported declarative constraint templates in our framework are:\n- AtMost1(a)\n- AtLeast1(a)\n- Response(a, b)\n- Precedence(a, b)\n- CoExistence(a, b)\n- NotCoExistence(a, b)\n- NotSuccession(a, b)\n- RespondedExistence(a, b)\n** Only use these templates. Do not invent new ones or use logical operators like “or”. **\n\n\nSome more instructions:\nIt is not possible to generate constraints like Response(a, (b or c)). The first and second elements must be a single activity\nIf several valid constraints refer to the same activities, keep only the most restrictive one. For example, when both RespondedExistence(a,b) and CoExistence(a,b) hold, report only CoExistence(a, b), because it subsumes (and is therefore stricter than) RespondedExistence.\n\n\nInteraction Protocol\nWhen you receive a new input:\n1) You may write reasoning steps (internally) before producing the JSON object — but never include them in the output.\n2) Once confident, generate and return the JSON object containing the constraints.\n3) Do not include explanation or commentary in the output.\n\n\nSome examples to learn the constraints and reasoning better:\nAtMost1(a): a occurs at most once. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Activity a may appear only as the final step of the project. Reasoning: Because a project has exactly one last step, a cannot be repeated.\n2. Completing activity a requires a single-use safety clearance that can be issued only once per project. Reasoning: Once the unique clearance is consumed, a second a cannot obtain it, so no second occurrence is legal.\n3. The project terminates immediately once activity a has been executed. Reasoning: Ending the schedule right after a leaves no remaining time slots in which another a could happen.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. The maintenance routine begins with a, proceeds through b and c, and then repeats a before concluding with d. Reasoning: a appears both at the start and again before the end—two occurrences.\n2. Every four-hour production cycle executes the sequence a, b, c; the plant runs three such cycles per day. Reasoning: Each cycle contains an a, so the day’s schedule contains a three separate times.\n3. The curriculum covers unit a in week 1 and revisits unit a for advanced exercises in week 4. Reasoning: The same activity a is taught twice in the single course timeline.\n\n\nAtLeast1(a): a occurs at least once, which means the existance of activity a is mandatory. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every case begins with activity a for baseline approval before any other work may proceed. Reasoning: The word “begins” makes a the very first step of every project run, guaranteeing one occurrence.\n2. In each instance, teams must perform activity a to certify the data set’s integrity. Reasoning: Filing the report is part of the process, and a is declared a mandatory predecessor, so at least one a precedes filing.\n3. Any customer-service ticket is automatically routed to a (triage) before it can enter the resolution queue. Reasoning: Since tickets must pass through the queue to be resolved, each ticket necessarily triggers one execution of a.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. When an order arrives with a pre-approved credit flag, the workflow jumps straight to b for planning and never calls a. Reasoning: The conditional branch bypasses a entirely whenever the flag is present, so some executions contain zero a’s.\n2. During off-season maintenance, technicians may optionally perform a or proceed directly to c if no calibration is needed. Reasoning: Because a is labeled ‘optional,’ a valid path exists in which the technicians skip it.\n3. A legacy integration still routes certain tickets directly to c, bypassing a and b altogether. Reasoning: Tickets entering through the legacy path never encounter a, violating the mandatory-presence requirement.\n\n\nResponse(a,b): If a occurs, then b occurs after a.\nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Each new client request triggers a for intake, followed immediately by b for verification before any other tasks may start. Reasoning: a is hard-coded to be immediately succeeded by b; no branch exists between them, so every time a appears, b necessarily follows.\n2. In the onboarding pipeline, once a (collecting identity documents) completes, the workflow engine automatically schedules b (identity validation) as the very next step. Reasoning: The engine inserts b right after a without user discretion, eliminating any path where a occurs and b does not.\n3. For every premium order, a (fraud screening) is executed and, upon success, the system proceeds to b (payment capture) before shipping. Reasoning: The success path from a programmatically advances to b; orders cannot ship (the process goal) until b completes, so a ➔ b is enforced.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-checkout flow, the system executes a (payment capture) and ships the order immediately, skipping the fraud-review step b. Reasoning: A occurs, but b never happens, so the implication fails.\n2. During a critical-outage fix, engineers apply a (hot patch) and close the incident log without performing the normal post-patch verification b. Reasoning: The emergency path lets the process end with a but without a subsequent b.\n3. For VIP passengers, security screening b is completed pre-flight, and if an ID issue arises later, staff perform a secondary identity swipe a right at the gate. Reasoning: Here b occurs before a, not after it, breaking the required order.\n\n\nPrecedence(a,b): b occurs only if preceded by a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The manufacturing line enables b (packaging) only after a sensor logs a (final assembly complete). Reasoning: The control logic keeps the packaging station disabled until the assembly-complete flag from a is present, so every time b runs an earlier a must already have finished.\n2. Within the insurance-claims app, b (payout) can be triggered solely when the system finds a prior a (manager approval) entry for that claim. Reasoning: The trigger condition for b is the existence of an approval record; consequently, whenever b happens the claim’s history necessarily contains a preceding a. \n3. The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete. Reasoning: The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-refund path, an agent can execute b (instant payout) with a supervisor override even when a (fraud check) has not been run. Reasoning: The override permits b to happen in runs where a never took place, so b is not guaranteed to be preceded by a.\n2. During a critical-outage hot-fix, engineers deploy the patch (b) first and run the automated test suite (a) only afterward if time allows. Reasoning: Here b occurs before or even without a, breaking the ‘preceded-by’ requirement.\n3. In urgent onboarding, IT provisions the account (b) while HR finishes creating the employee record (a) the next day. Reasoning: The provisioning action b can occur one or more days before a, contradicting the rule.\n\n\nCoExistence(a,b): a and b occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every new support case triggers a (open-ticket record) and, in the same transaction, auto-creates b (initial customer-reply template). Reasoning: The system executes a composite routine that writes both database rows atomically, so whenever a is logged b is logged too, and neither appears alone.\n2. For each vendor purchase, the ERP posts a (goods-received note) and simultaneously posts b (accounts-payable accrual) in the same commit. Reasoning: Posting logic is wrapped in a single database transaction—if either insert fails the whole transaction rolls back—therefore the system state contains both or neither.\n3. Publishing a news article executes a (content push to CDN) and b (metadata push to search index) as a locked job pair—neither job can be run in isolation. Reasoning: The deploy orchestrator groups them under one job ID; a switch disables standalone execution, guaranteeing paired occurrence.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. For micro-refunds, the agent can execute b (instant payout) while the fraud-check a is skipped. Reasoning: A valid path exists in which b occurs but a does not, so the pair does not always appear together.\n2. A legacy printer service fires b (shipping-label print) on address verification, but if inventory allocation a does not occur, the label still prints. Reasoning: The system can produce b even though a has not completed, so the two are not inseparable.\n3. When a student repeats a passed module, the registrar records a (module enrollment) but suppresses b (fee payment). Reasoning: This branch shows a without b, violating the rule.\n\n  \nNotCoExistence(a,b): a and b never occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. In the loan pipeline, low-risk applications flow through a (automatic approval) while high-risk ones are routed to b (manual committee review). Reasoning: The risk-based router selects exactly one mutually exclusive branch; a case flagged low-risk can never enter the high-risk branch and vice-versa, so no single run contains both a and b.\n2. At checkout a customer must choose either a (credit-card payment) or b (cash-on-delivery); the payment gateway disables the unselected option. Reasoning: The UI enforces a single-selection radio button and downstream code validates one—and only one—payment type, ensuring the two activities never co-appear in the same order.\n3. Regulations permit a sample to be processed via a (wet-lab chemical protocol) for liquid specimens or b (dry-lab bioinformatics) for genomic data, explicitly banning mixed handling. Reasoning: Compliance software validates specimen type before queuing the job and rejects any attempt to schedule the alternate protocol, so a single specimen workflow can contain only one of the two.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Borderline loan applications first undergo a (automated scoring) and then proceed to b (manual credit-committee review) before a decision is issued. Reasoning: A single borderline application clearly contains the sequence a → b, so both activities occur together.\n2. For VIP travel bookings, the system performs a (automatic ticket issuance) while simultaneously dispatching b (manual travel-agent confirmation) as an extra layer of service. Reasoning: Each VIP booking spawns both automated and manual tasks, so a and b co-exist in the same booking workflow.\n3. When a customer changes address on an open order, support runs a (address verification) and then launches b (fraud re-check) within the same service call. Reasoning: The single service request explicitly chains a and b together.\n\nNotSuccession(a,b): b cannot occur after a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The customer-complaint workflow finishes with a (final client sign-off); when that step is saved the ticket auto-closes, making b (internal escalation) impossible afterwards. Reasoning: Activity a terminates the case, so no subsequent task—including b—can be executed.\n2. During checkout, b (fraud screening) is run before payment capture, and once a (payment capture) succeeds the order is locked from further screening. Reasoning: b is always completed earlier in the timeline; after a, the lock prevents any new b event.\n3. In emergency releases, committing a (force merge to main) marks CI job b (code linting) as ‘skipped’ and locks the pipeline. Reasoning: The status change blocks b from running after the merge.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Auditors record a (preliminary sign-off) and then launch b (final compliance audit) to complete the dossier. Reasoning: The workflow explicitly places b after a, proving the forbidden order can occur.\n2. The emergency-release pipeline performs a (force deploy) and only afterwards runs b (post-deploy regression tests). Reasoning: A single deployment run contains a first and b later, so b follows a.\n3. The warehouse seals pallets with a (shipment sealing) and later performs b (random quality-inspection pulls) before loading the truck. Reasoning: Quality inspections b are scheduled chronologically after pallet sealing a.\n\nRespondedExistence(a,b): If a occurs in the trace, then b occurs as well. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Any training session that records a (hands-on lab) must also show b (theory module) on the same attendance sheet. Reasoning: The attendance sheet is invalid without entries for both modules; thus a session containing a always contains b, with order left to the organizer.\n2. Every incident record that contains a (temporary workaround) is required by policy to include b (permanent resolution) in the same incident file. Reasoning: The data model treats the pair as mandatory fields on the same record; whichever is entered first, the other must exist before closure, so any trace with a inevitably contains b, but timing is flexible.\n3. If a sprint backlog includes a (security epic), governance checks confirm that b (pen-test task) is also on the board. Reasoning: Board validation happens at sprint start and end, ensuring both items co-appear even though teams pick their own ordering.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the quick-refund lane, an agent can execute a (issue refund) and close the ticket, while b (root-cause investigation) is marked ‘optional’ and often skipped. Reasoning: A legitimate trace exists where a is present and b never appears, contradicting the implication.\n2. For VIP travelers, the airline auto-issues a (boarding pass) but waives b (secondary identity check) unless a random audit flag is raised. Reasoning: Many VIP traces show a without the corresponding b event.\n3. A late-stage sales opportunity logs a (verbal commitment) immediately, while b (formal contract upload) may be omitted if the deal falls through. Reasoning: When a deal collapses, the trace holds a but never records b.\n\nFor each task, I provide the set of activity labels that exist in the process.\n\n\nThe list of activities used in this process are the following.

    "full_prompt": "Task Overview:\nYou are an assistant that helps translate free-text process descriptions into declarative process constraints.\n\nYour goal is to:\n1) Identify declarative constraints from the text.\n2) Return them in strict JSON format (see below).\n\nJSON Output Format:\nYou must always return a single valid JSON object in this format:\n** Do not return any explanation or markdown. Only return a single valid JSON object exactly like this.**\n{\n  \"constraints\": [\n    {\n      \"template\": \"Response\",\n      \"parameters\": [[\"a\"], [\"b\"]]\n    },\n    {\n      \"template\": \"AtMost1\",\n      \"parameters\": [[\"c\"]]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nSupported Templates:\nConsider only the following declarative constraint definitions where a, b, c, and d are activities and template example-template(x,y) specifies a template named \"example-template\" and x and y can be one of the activities from the set of all activities. The supported declarative constraint templates in our framework are:\n- AtMost1(a)\n- AtLeast1(a)\n- Response(a, b)\n- Precedence(a, b)\n- CoExistence(a, b)\n- NotCoExistence(a, b)\n- NotSuccession(a, b)\n- RespondedExistence(a, b)\n** Only use these templates. Do not invent new ones or use logical operators like “or”. **\n\n\nSome more instructions:\nIt is not possible to generate constraints like Response(a, (b or c)). The first and second elements must be a single activity\nIf several valid constraints refer to the same activities, keep only the most restrictive one. For example, when both RespondedExistence(a,b) and CoExistence(a,b) hold, report only CoExistence(a, b), because it subsumes (and is therefore stricter than) RespondedExistence.\n\n\nInteraction Protocol\nWhen you receive a new input:\n1) You may write reasoning steps (internally) before producing the JSON object — but never include them in the output.\n2) Once confident, generate and return the JSON object containing the constraints.\n3) Do not include explanation or commentary in the output.\n\n\nSome examples to learn the constraints and reasoning better:\nAtMost1(a): a occurs at most once. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Activity a may appear only as the final step of the project. Reasoning: Because a project has exactly one last step, a cannot be repeated.\n2. Completing activity a requires a single-use safety clearance that can be issued only once per project. Reasoning: Once the unique clearance is consumed, a second a cannot obtain it, so no second occurrence is legal.\n3. The project terminates immediately once activity a has been executed. Reasoning: Ending the schedule right after a leaves no remaining time slots in which another a could happen.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. The maintenance routine begins with a, proceeds through b and c, and then repeats a before concluding with d. Reasoning: a appears both at the start and again before the end—two occurrences.\n2. Every four-hour production cycle executes the sequence a, b, c; the plant runs three such cycles per day. Reasoning: Each cycle contains an a, so the day’s schedule contains a three separate times.\n3. The curriculum covers unit a in week 1 and revisits unit a for advanced exercises in week 4. Reasoning: The same activity a is taught twice in the single course timeline.\n\n\nAtLeast1(a): a occurs at least once, which means the existance of activity a is mandatory. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every case begins with activity a for baseline approval before any other work may proceed. Reasoning: The word “begins” makes a the very first step of every project run, guaranteeing one occurrence.\n2. In each instance, teams must perform activity a to certify the data set’s integrity. Reasoning: Filing the report is part of the process, and a is declared a mandatory predecessor, so at least one a precedes filing.\n3. Any customer-service ticket is automatically routed to a (triage) before it can enter the resolution queue. Reasoning: Since tickets must pass through the queue to be resolved, each ticket necessarily triggers one execution of a.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. When an order arrives with a pre-approved credit flag, the workflow jumps straight to b for planning and never calls a. Reasoning: The conditional branch bypasses a entirely whenever the flag is present, so some executions contain zero a’s.\n2. During off-season maintenance, technicians may optionally perform a or proceed directly to c if no calibration is needed. Reasoning: Because a is labeled ‘optional,’ a valid path exists in which the technicians skip it.\n3. A legacy integration still routes certain tickets directly to c, bypassing a and b altogether. Reasoning: Tickets entering through the legacy path never encounter a, violating the mandatory-presence requirement.\n\n\nResponse(a,b): If a occurs, then b occurs after a.\nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Each new client request triggers a for intake, followed immediately by b for verification before any other tasks may start. Reasoning: a is hard-coded to be immediately succeeded by b; no branch exists between them, so every time a appears, b necessarily follows.\n2. In the onboarding pipeline, once a (collecting identity documents) completes, the workflow engine automatically schedules b (identity validation) as the very next step. Reasoning: The engine inserts b right after a without user discretion, eliminating any path where a occurs and b does not.\n3. For every premium order, a (fraud screening) is executed and, upon success, the system proceeds to b (payment capture) before shipping. Reasoning: The success path from a programmatically advances to b; orders cannot ship (the process goal) until b completes, so a ➔ b is enforced.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-checkout flow, the system executes a (payment capture) and ships the order immediately, skipping the fraud-review step b. Reasoning: A occurs, but b never happens, so the implication fails.\n2. During a critical-outage fix, engineers apply a (hot patch) and close the incident log without performing the normal post-patch verification b. Reasoning: The emergency path lets the process end with a but without a subsequent b.\n3. For VIP passengers, security screening b is completed pre-flight, and if an ID issue arises later, staff perform a secondary identity swipe a right at the gate. Reasoning: Here b occurs before a, not after it, breaking the required order.\n\n\nPrecedence(a,b): b occurs only if preceded by a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The manufacturing line enables b (packaging) only after a sensor logs a (final assembly complete). Reasoning: The control logic keeps the packaging station disabled until the assembly-complete flag from a is present, so every time b runs an earlier a must already have finished.\n2. Within the insurance-claims app, b (payout) can be triggered solely when the system finds a prior a (manager approval) entry for that claim. Reasoning: The trigger condition for b is the existence of an approval record; consequently, whenever b happens the claim’s history necessarily contains a preceding a. \n3. The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete. Reasoning: The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-refund path, an agent can execute b (instant payout) with a supervisor override even when a (fraud check) has not been run. Reasoning: The override permits b to happen in runs where a never took place, so b is not guaranteed to be preceded by a.\n2. During a critical-outage hot-fix, engineers deploy the patch (b) first and run the automated test suite (a) only afterward if time allows. Reasoning: Here b occurs before or even without a, breaking the ‘preceded-by’ requirement.\n3. In urgent onboarding, IT provisions the account (b) while HR finishes creating the employee record (a) the next day. Reasoning: The provisioning action b can occur one or more days before a, contradicting the rule.\n\n\nCoExistence(a,b): a and b occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every new support case triggers a (open-ticket record) and, in the same transaction, auto-creates b (initial customer-reply template). Reasoning: The system executes a composite routine that writes both database rows atomically, so whenever a is logged b is logged too, and neither appears alone.\n2. For each vendor purchase, the ERP posts a (goods-received note) and simultaneously posts b (accounts-payable accrual) in the same commit. Reasoning: Posting logic is wrapped in a single database transaction—if either insert fails the whole transaction rolls back—therefore the system state contains both or neither.\n3. Publishing a news article executes a (content push to CDN) and b (metadata push to search index) as a locked job pair—neither job can be run in isolation. Reasoning: The deploy orchestrator groups them under one job ID; a switch disables standalone execution, guaranteeing paired occurrence.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. For micro-refunds, the agent can execute b (instant payout) while the fraud-check a is skipped. Reasoning: A valid path exists in which b occurs but a does not, so the pair does not always appear together.\n2. A legacy printer service fires b (shipping-label print) on address verification, but if inventory allocation a does not occur, the label still prints. Reasoning: The system can produce b even though a has not completed, so the two are not inseparable.\n3. When a student repeats a passed module, the registrar records a (module enrollment) but suppresses b (fee payment). Reasoning: This branch shows a without b, violating the rule.\n\n  \nNotCoExistence(a,b): a and b never occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. In the loan pipeline, low-risk applications flow through a (automatic approval) while high-risk ones are routed to b (manual committee review). Reasoning: The risk-based router selects exactly one mutually exclusive branch; a case flagged low-risk can never enter the high-risk branch and vice-versa, so no single run contains both a and b.\n2. At checkout a customer must choose either a (credit-card payment) or b (cash-on-delivery); the payment gateway disables the unselected option. Reasoning: The UI enforces a single-selection radio button and downstream code validates one—and only one—payment type, ensuring the two activities never co-appear in the same order.\n3. Regulations permit a sample to be processed via a (wet-lab chemical protocol) for liquid specimens or b (dry-lab bioinformatics) for genomic data, explicitly banning mixed handling. Reasoning: Compliance software validates specimen type before queuing the job and rejects any attempt to schedule the alternate protocol, so a single specimen workflow can contain only one of the two.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Borderline loan applications first undergo a (automated scoring) and then proceed to b (manual credit-committee review) before a decision is issued. Reasoning: A single borderline application clearly contains the sequence a → b, so both activities occur together.\n2. For VIP travel bookings, the system performs a (automatic ticket issuance) while simultaneously dispatching b (manual travel-agent confirmation) as an extra layer of service. Reasoning: Each VIP booking spawns both automated and manual tasks, so a and b co-exist in the same booking workflow.\n3. When a customer changes address on an open order, support runs a (address verification) and then launches b (fraud re-check) within the same service call. Reasoning: The single service request explicitly chains a and b together.\n\nNotSuccession(a,b): b cannot occur after a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The customer-complaint workflow finishes with a (final client sign-off); when that step is saved the ticket auto-closes, making b (internal escalation) impossible afterwards. Reasoning: Activity a terminates the case, so no subsequent task—including b—can be executed.\n2. During checkout, b (fraud screening) is run before payment capture, and once a (payment capture) succeeds the order is locked from further screening. Reasoning: b is always completed earlier in the timeline; after a, the lock prevents any new b event.\n3. In emergency releases, committing a (force merge to main) marks CI job b (code linting) as ‘skipped’ and locks the pipeline. Reasoning: The status change blocks b from running after the merge.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Auditors record a (preliminary sign-off) and then launch b (final compliance audit) to complete the dossier. Reasoning: The workflow explicitly places b after a, proving the forbidden order can occur.\n2. The emergency-release pipeline performs a (force deploy) and only afterwards runs b (post-deploy regression tests). Reasoning: A single deployment run contains a first and b later, so b follows a.\n3. The warehouse seals pallets with a (shipment sealing) and later performs b (random quality-inspection pulls) before loading the truck. Reasoning: Quality inspections b are scheduled chronologically after pallet sealing a.\n\nRespondedExistence(a,b): If a occurs in the trace, then b occurs as well. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Any training session that records a (hands-on lab) must also show b (theory module) on the same attendance sheet. Reasoning: The attendance sheet is invalid without entries for both modules; thus a session containing a always contains b, with order left to the organizer.\n2. Every incident record that contains a (temporary workaround) is required by policy to include b (permanent resolution) in the same incident file. Reasoning: The data model treats the pair as mandatory fields on the same record; whichever is entered first, the other must exist before closure, so any trace with a inevitably contains b, but timing is flexible.\n3. If a sprint backlog includes a (security epic), governance checks confirm that b (pen-test task) is also on the board. Reasoning: Board validation happens at sprint start and end, ensuring both items co-appear even though teams pick their own ordering.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the quick-refund lane, an agent can execute a (issue refund) and close the ticket, while b (root-cause investigation) is marked ‘optional’ and often skipped. Reasoning: A legitimate trace exists where a is present and b never appears, contradicting the implication.\n2. For VIP travelers, the airline auto-issues a (boarding pass) but waives b (secondary identity check) unless a random audit flag is raised. Reasoning: Many VIP traces show a without the corresponding b event.\n3. A late-stage sales opportunity logs a (verbal commitment) immediately, while b (formal contract upload) may be omitted if the deal falls through. Reasoning: When a deal collapses, the trace holds a but never records b.\n\nFor each task, I provide the set of activity labels that exist in the process.\n\n\nThe list of activities used in this process are the following.

During checkout, b (fraud screening) is run before payment capture, and once a (payment capture) succeeds the order is locked from further screening. Reasoning: b is always completed earlier in the timeline; after a, the lock prevents any new b event.\n3. In emergency releases, committing a (force merge to main) marks CI job b (code linting) as ‘skipped’ and locks the pipeline. Reasoning: The status change blocks b from running after the merge.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Auditors record a (preliminary sign-off) and then launch b (final compliance audit) to complete the dossier. Reasoning: The workflow explicitly places b after a, proving the forbidden order can occur.\n2. The emergency-release pipeline performs a (force deploy) and only afterwards runs b (post-deploy regression tests). Reasoning: A single deployment run contains a first and b later, so b follows a.\n3. The warehouse seals pallets with a (shipment sealing) and later performs b (random quality-inspection pulls) before loading the truck. Reasoning: Quality inspections b are scheduled chronologically after pallet sealing a.\n\nRespondedExistence(a,b): If a occurs in the trace, then b occurs as well. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Any training session that records a (hands-on lab) must also show b (theory module) on the same attendance sheet. Reasoning: The attendance sheet is invalid without entries for both modules; thus a session containing a always contains b, with order left to the organizer.\n2. Every incident record that contains a (temporary workaround) is required by policy to include b (permanent resolution) in the same incident file. Reasoning: The data model treats the pair as mandatory fields on the same record; whichever is entered first, the other must exist before closure, so any trace with a inevitably contains b, but timing is flexible.\n3. If a sprint backlog includes a (security epic), governance checks confirm that b (pen-test task) is also on the board. Reasoning: Board validation happens at sprint start and end, ensuring both items co-appear even though teams pick their own ordering.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the quick-refund lane, an agent can execute a (issue refund) and close the ticket, while b (root-cause investigation) is marked ‘optional’ and often skipped. Reasoning: A legitimate trace exists where a is present and b never appears, contradicting the implication.\n2. For VIP travelers, the airline auto-issues a (boarding pass) but waives b (secondary identity check) unless a random audit flag is raised. Reasoning: Many VIP traces show a without the corresponding b event.\n3. A late-stage sales opportunity logs a (verbal commitment) immediately, while b (formal contract upload) may be omitted if the deal falls through. Reasoning: When a deal collapses, the trace holds a but never records b.\n\nFor each task, I provide the set of activity labels that exist in the process.\n\n\nThe list of activities used in this process are the following.

    "full_prompt": "Task Overview:\nYou are an assistant that helps translate free-text process descriptions into declarative process constraints.\n\nYour goal is to:\n1) Identify declarative constraints from the text.\n2) Return them in strict JSON format (see below).\n\nJSON Output Format:\nYou must always return a single valid JSON object in this format:\n** Do not return any explanation or markdown. Only return a single valid JSON object exactly like this.**\n{\n  \"constraints\": [\n    {\n      \"template\": \"Response\",\n      \"parameters\": [[\"a\"], [\"b\"]]\n    },\n    {\n      \"template\": \"AtMost1\",\n      \"parameters\": [[\"c\"]]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nSupported Templates:\nConsider only the following declarative constraint definitions where a, b, c, and d are activities and template example-template(x,y) specifies a template named \"example-template\" and x and y can be one of the activities from the set of all activities. The supported declarative constraint templates in our framework are:\n- AtMost1(a)\n- AtLeast1(a)\n- Response(a, b)\n- Precedence(a, b)\n- CoExistence(a, b)\n- NotCoExistence(a, b)\n- NotSuccession(a, b)\n- RespondedExistence(a, b)\n** Only use these templates. Do not invent new ones or use logical operators like “or”. **\n\n\nSome more instructions:\nIt is not possible to generate constraints like Response(a, (b or c)). The first and second elements must be a single activity\nIf several valid constraints refer to the same activities, keep only the most restrictive one. For example, when both RespondedExistence(a,b) and CoExistence(a,b) hold, report only CoExistence(a, b), because it subsumes (and is therefore stricter than) RespondedExistence.\n\n\nInteraction Protocol\nWhen you receive a new input:\n1) You may write reasoning steps (internally) before producing the JSON object — but never include them in the output.\n2) Once confident, generate and return the JSON object containing the constraints.\n3) Do not include explanation or commentary in the output.\n\n\nSome examples to learn the constraints and reasoning better:\nAtMost1(a): a occurs at most once. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Activity a may appear only as the final step of the project. Reasoning: Because a project has exactly one last step, a cannot be repeated.\n2. Completing activity a requires a single-use safety clearance that can be issued only once per project. Reasoning: Once the unique clearance is consumed, a second a cannot obtain it, so no second occurrence is legal.\n3. The project terminates immediately once activity a has been executed. Reasoning: Ending the schedule right after a leaves no remaining time slots in which another a could happen.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. The maintenance routine begins with a, proceeds through b and c, and then repeats a before concluding with d. Reasoning: a appears both at the start and again before the end—two occurrences.\n2. Every four-hour production cycle executes the sequence a, b, c; the plant runs three such cycles per day. Reasoning: Each cycle contains an a, so the day’s schedule contains a three separate times.\n3. The curriculum covers unit a in week 1 and revisits unit a for advanced exercises in week 4. Reasoning: The same activity a is taught twice in the single course timeline.\n\n\nAtLeast1(a): a occurs at least once, which means the existance of activity a is mandatory. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every case begins with activity a for baseline approval before any other work may proceed. Reasoning: The word “begins” makes a the very first step of every project run, guaranteeing one occurrence.\n2. In each instance, teams must perform activity a to certify the data set’s integrity. Reasoning: Filing the report is part of the process, and a is declared a mandatory predecessor, so at least one a precedes filing.\n3. Any customer-service ticket is automatically routed to a (triage) before it can enter the resolution queue. Reasoning: Since tickets must pass through the queue to be resolved, each ticket necessarily triggers one execution of a.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. When an order arrives with a pre-approved credit flag, the workflow jumps straight to b for planning and never calls a. Reasoning: The conditional branch bypasses a entirely whenever the flag is present, so some executions contain zero a’s.\n2. During off-season maintenance, technicians may optionally perform a or proceed directly to c if no calibration is needed. Reasoning: Because a is labeled ‘optional,’ a valid path exists in which the technicians skip it.\n3. A legacy integration still routes certain tickets directly to c, bypassing a and b altogether. Reasoning: Tickets entering through the legacy path never encounter a, violating the mandatory-presence requirement.\n\n\nResponse(a,b): If a occurs, then b occurs after a.\nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Each new client request triggers a for intake, followed immediately by b for verification before any other tasks may start. Reasoning: a is hard-coded to be immediately succeeded by b; no branch exists between them, so every time a appears, b necessarily follows.\n2. In the onboarding pipeline, once a (collecting identity documents) completes, the workflow engine automatically schedules b (identity validation) as the very next step. Reasoning: The engine inserts b right after a without user discretion, eliminating any path where a occurs and b does not.\n3. For every premium order, a (fraud screening) is executed and, upon success, the system proceeds to b (payment capture) before shipping. Reasoning: The success path from a programmatically advances to b; orders cannot ship (the process goal) until b completes, so a ➔ b is enforced.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-checkout flow, the system executes a (payment capture) and ships the order immediately, skipping the fraud-review step b. Reasoning: A occurs, but b never happens, so the implication fails.\n2. During a critical-outage fix, engineers apply a (hot patch) and close the incident log without performing the normal post-patch verification b. Reasoning: The emergency path lets the process end with a but without a subsequent b.\n3. For VIP passengers, security screening b is completed pre-flight, and if an ID issue arises later, staff perform a secondary identity swipe a right at the gate. Reasoning: Here b occurs before a, not after it, breaking the required order.\n\n\nPrecedence(a,b): b occurs only if preceded by a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The manufacturing line enables b (packaging) only after a sensor logs a (final assembly complete). Reasoning: The control logic keeps the packaging station disabled until the assembly-complete flag from a is present, so every time b runs an earlier a must already have finished.\n2. Within the insurance-claims app, b (payout) can be triggered solely when the system finds a prior a (manager approval) entry for that claim. Reasoning: The trigger condition for b is the existence of an approval record; consequently, whenever b happens the claim’s history necessarily contains a preceding a. \n3. The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete. Reasoning: The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-refund path, an agent can execute b (instant payout) with a supervisor override even when a (fraud check) has not been run. Reasoning: The override permits b to happen in runs where a never took place, so b is not guaranteed to be preceded by a.\n2. During a critical-outage hot-fix, engineers deploy the patch (b) first and run the automated test suite (a) only afterward if time allows. Reasoning: Here b occurs before or even without a, breaking the ‘preceded-by’ requirement.\n3. In urgent onboarding, IT provisions the account (b) while HR finishes creating the employee record (a) the next day. Reasoning: The provisioning action b can occur one or more days before a, contradicting the rule.\n\n\nCoExistence(a,b): a and b occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every new support case triggers a (open-ticket record) and, in the same transaction, auto-creates b (initial customer-reply template). Reasoning: The system executes a composite routine that writes both database rows atomically, so whenever a is logged b is logged too, and neither appears alone.\n2. For each vendor purchase, the ERP posts a (goods-received note) and simultaneously posts b (accounts-payable accrual) in the same commit. Reasoning: Posting logic is wrapped in a single database transaction—if either insert fails the whole transaction rolls back—therefore the system state contains both or neither.\n3. Publishing a news article executes a (content push to CDN) and b (metadata push to search index) as a locked job pair—neither job can be run in isolation. Reasoning: The deploy orchestrator groups them under one job ID; a switch disables standalone execution, guaranteeing paired occurrence.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. For micro-refunds, the agent can execute b (instant payout) while the fraud-check a is skipped. Reasoning: A valid path exists in which b occurs but a does not, so the pair does not always appear together.\n2. A legacy printer service fires b (shipping-label print) on address verification, but if inventory allocation a does not occur, the label still prints. Reasoning: The system can produce b even though a has not completed, so the two are not inseparable.\n3. When a student repeats a passed module, the registrar records a (module enrollment) but suppresses b (fee payment). Reasoning: This branch shows a without b, violating the rule.\n\n  \nNotCoExistence(a,b): a and b never occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. In the loan pipeline, low-risk applications flow through a (automatic approval) while high-risk ones are routed to b (manual committee review). Reasoning: The risk-based router selects exactly one mutually exclusive branch; a case flagged low-risk can never enter the high-risk branch and vice-versa, so no single run contains both a and b.\n2. At checkout a customer must choose either a (credit-card payment) or b (cash-on-delivery); the payment gateway disables the unselected option. Reasoning: The UI enforces a single-selection radio button and downstream code validates one—and only one—payment type, ensuring the two activities never co-appear in the same order.\n3. Regulations permit a sample to be processed via a (wet-lab chemical protocol) for liquid specimens or b (dry-lab bioinformatics) for genomic data, explicitly banning mixed handling. Reasoning: Compliance software validates specimen type before queuing the job and rejects any attempt to schedule the alternate protocol, so a single specimen workflow can contain only one of the two.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Borderline loan applications first undergo a (automated scoring) and then proceed to b (manual credit-committee review) before a decision is issued. Reasoning: A single borderline application clearly contains the sequence a → b, so both activities occur together.\n2. For VIP travel bookings, the system performs a (automatic ticket issuance) while simultaneously dispatching b (manual travel-agent confirmation) as an extra layer of service. Reasoning: Each VIP booking spawns both automated and manual tasks, so a and b co-exist in the same booking workflow.\n3. When a customer changes address on an open order, support runs a (address verification) and then launches b (fraud re-check) within the same service call. Reasoning: The single service request explicitly chains a and b together.\n\nNotSuccession(a,b): b cannot occur after a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The customer-complaint workflow finishes with a (final client sign-off); when that step is saved the ticket auto-closes, making b (internal escalation) impossible afterwards. Reasoning: Activity a terminates the case, so no subsequent task—including b—can be executed.\n2. During checkout, b (fraud screening) is run before payment capture, and once a (payment capture) succeeds the order is locked from further screening. Reasoning: b is always completed earlier in the timeline; after a, the lock prevents any new b event.\n3.

Reasoning: Quality inspections b are scheduled chronologically after pallet sealing a.\n\nRespondedExistence(a,b): If a occurs in the trace, then b occurs as well. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Any training session that records a (hands-on lab) must also show b (theory module) on the same attendance sheet. Reasoning: The attendance sheet is invalid without entries for both modules; thus a session containing a always contains b, with order left to the organizer.\n2. Every incident record that contains a (temporary workaround) is required by policy to include b (permanent resolution) in the same incident file. Reasoning: The data model treats the pair as mandatory fields on the same record; whichever is entered first, the other must exist before closure, so any trace with a inevitably contains b, but timing is flexible.\n3. If a sprint backlog includes a (security epic), governance checks confirm that b (pen-test task) is also on the board. Reasoning: Board validation happens at sprint start and end, ensuring both items co-appear even though teams pick their own ordering.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the quick-refund lane, an agent can execute a (issue refund) and close the ticket, while b (root-cause investigation) is marked ‘optional’ and often skipped. Reasoning: A legitimate trace exists where a is present and b never appears, contradicting the implication.\n2. For VIP travelers, the airline auto-issues a (boarding pass) but waives b (secondary identity check) unless a random audit flag is raised. Reasoning: Many VIP traces show a without the corresponding b event.\n3. A late-stage sales opportunity logs a (verbal commitment) immediately, while b (formal contract upload) may be omitted if the deal falls through. Reasoning: When a deal collapses, the trace holds a but never records b.\n\nFor each task, I provide the set of activity labels that exist in the process.\n\n\nThe list of activities used in this process are the following.

    "full_prompt": "Task Overview:\nYou are an assistant that helps translate free-text process descriptions into declarative process constraints.\n\nYour goal is to:\n1) Identify declarative constraints from the text.\n2) Return them in strict JSON format (see below).\n\nJSON Output Format:\nYou must always return a single valid JSON object in this format:\n** Do not return any explanation or markdown. Only return a single valid JSON object exactly like this.**\n{\n  \"constraints\": [\n    {\n      \"template\": \"Response\",\n      \"parameters\": [[\"a\"], [\"b\"]]\n    },\n    {\n      \"template\": \"AtMost1\",\n      \"parameters\": [[\"c\"]]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nSupported Templates:\nConsider only the following declarative constraint definitions where a, b, c, and d are activities and template example-template(x,y) specifies a template named \"example-template\" and x and y can be one of the activities from the set of all activities. The supported declarative constraint templates in our framework are:\n- AtMost1(a)\n- AtLeast1(a)\n- Response(a, b)\n- Precedence(a, b)\n- CoExistence(a, b)\n- NotCoExistence(a, b)\n- NotSuccession(a, b)\n- RespondedExistence(a, b)\n** Only use these templates. Do not invent new ones or use logical operators like “or”. **\n\n\nSome more instructions:\nIt is not possible to generate constraints like Response(a, (b or c)). The first and second elements must be a single activity\nIf several valid constraints refer to the same activities, keep only the most restrictive one. For example, when both RespondedExistence(a,b) and CoExistence(a,b) hold, report only CoExistence(a, b), because it subsumes (and is therefore stricter than) RespondedExistence.\n\n\nInteraction Protocol\nWhen you receive a new input:\n1) You may write reasoning steps (internally) before producing the JSON object — but never include them in the output.\n2) Once confident, generate and return the JSON object containing the constraints.\n3) Do not include explanation or commentary in the output.\n\n\nSome examples to learn the constraints and reasoning better:\nAtMost1(a): a occurs at most once. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Activity a may appear only as the final step of the project. Reasoning: Because a project has exactly one last step, a cannot be repeated.\n2. Completing activity a requires a single-use safety clearance that can be issued only once per project. Reasoning: Once the unique clearance is consumed, a second a cannot obtain it, so no second occurrence is legal.\n3. The project terminates immediately once activity a has been executed. Reasoning: Ending the schedule right after a leaves no remaining time slots in which another a could happen.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. The maintenance routine begins with a, proceeds through b and c, and then repeats a before concluding with d. Reasoning: a appears both at the start and again before the end—two occurrences.\n2. Every four-hour production cycle executes the sequence a, b, c; the plant runs three such cycles per day. Reasoning: Each cycle contains an a, so the day’s schedule contains a three separate times.\n3. The curriculum covers unit a in week 1 and revisits unit a for advanced exercises in week 4. Reasoning: The same activity a is taught twice in the single course timeline.\n\n\nAtLeast1(a): a occurs at least once, which means the existance of activity a is mandatory. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every case begins with activity a for baseline approval before any other work may proceed. Reasoning: The word “begins” makes a the very first step of every project run, guaranteeing one occurrence.\n2. In each instance, teams must perform activity a to certify the data set’s integrity. Reasoning: Filing the report is part of the process, and a is declared a mandatory predecessor, so at least one a precedes filing.\n3. Any customer-service ticket is automatically routed to a (triage) before it can enter the resolution queue. Reasoning: Since tickets must pass through the queue to be resolved, each ticket necessarily triggers one execution of a.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. When an order arrives with a pre-approved credit flag, the workflow jumps straight to b for planning and never calls a. Reasoning: The conditional branch bypasses a entirely whenever the flag is present, so some executions contain zero a’s.\n2. During off-season maintenance, technicians may optionally perform a or proceed directly to c if no calibration is needed. Reasoning: Because a is labeled ‘optional,’ a valid path exists in which the technicians skip it.\n3. A legacy integration still routes certain tickets directly to c, bypassing a and b altogether. Reasoning: Tickets entering through the legacy path never encounter a, violating the mandatory-presence requirement.\n\n\nResponse(a,b): If a occurs, then b occurs after a.\nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Each new client request triggers a for intake, followed immediately by b for verification before any other tasks may start. Reasoning: a is hard-coded to be immediately succeeded by b; no branch exists between them, so every time a appears, b necessarily follows.\n2. In the onboarding pipeline, once a (collecting identity documents) completes, the workflow engine automatically schedules b (identity validation) as the very next step. Reasoning: The engine inserts b right after a without user discretion, eliminating any path where a occurs and b does not.\n3. For every premium order, a (fraud screening) is executed and, upon success, the system proceeds to b (payment capture) before shipping. Reasoning: The success path from a programmatically advances to b; orders cannot ship (the process goal) until b completes, so a ➔ b is enforced.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-checkout flow, the system executes a (payment capture) and ships the order immediately, skipping the fraud-review step b. Reasoning: A occurs, but b never happens, so the implication fails.\n2. During a critical-outage fix, engineers apply a (hot patch) and close the incident log without performing the normal post-patch verification b. Reasoning: The emergency path lets the process end with a but without a subsequent b.\n3. For VIP passengers, security screening b is completed pre-flight, and if an ID issue arises later, staff perform a secondary identity swipe a right at the gate. Reasoning: Here b occurs before a, not after it, breaking the required order.\n\n\nPrecedence(a,b): b occurs only if preceded by a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The manufacturing line enables b (packaging) only after a sensor logs a (final assembly complete). Reasoning: The control logic keeps the packaging station disabled until the assembly-complete flag from a is present, so every time b runs an earlier a must already have finished.\n2. Within the insurance-claims app, b (payout) can be triggered solely when the system finds a prior a (manager approval) entry for that claim. Reasoning: The trigger condition for b is the existence of an approval record; consequently, whenever b happens the claim’s history necessarily contains a preceding a. \n3. The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete. Reasoning: The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-refund path, an agent can execute b (instant payout) with a supervisor override even when a (fraud check) has not been run. Reasoning: The override permits b to happen in runs where a never took place, so b is not guaranteed to be preceded by a.\n2. During a critical-outage hot-fix, engineers deploy the patch (b) first and run the automated test suite (a) only afterward if time allows. Reasoning: Here b occurs before or even without a, breaking the ‘preceded-by’ requirement.\n3. In urgent onboarding, IT provisions the account (b) while HR finishes creating the employee record (a) the next day. Reasoning: The provisioning action b can occur one or more days before a, contradicting the rule.\n\n\nCoExistence(a,b): a and b occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every new support case triggers a (open-ticket record) and, in the same transaction, auto-creates b (initial customer-reply template). Reasoning: The system executes a composite routine that writes both database rows atomically, so whenever a is logged b is logged too, and neither appears alone.\n2. For each vendor purchase, the ERP posts a (goods-received note) and simultaneously posts b (accounts-payable accrual) in the same commit. Reasoning: Posting logic is wrapped in a single database transaction—if either insert fails the whole transaction rolls back—therefore the system state contains both or neither.\n3. Publishing a news article executes a (content push to CDN) and b (metadata push to search index) as a locked job pair—neither job can be run in isolation. Reasoning: The deploy orchestrator groups them under one job ID; a switch disables standalone execution, guaranteeing paired occurrence.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. For micro-refunds, the agent can execute b (instant payout) while the fraud-check a is skipped. Reasoning: A valid path exists in which b occurs but a does not, so the pair does not always appear together.\n2. A legacy printer service fires b (shipping-label print) on address verification, but if inventory allocation a does not occur, the label still prints. Reasoning: The system can produce b even though a has not completed, so the two are not inseparable.\n3. When a student repeats a passed module, the registrar records a (module enrollment) but suppresses b (fee payment). Reasoning: This branch shows a without b, violating the rule.\n\n  \nNotCoExistence(a,b): a and b never occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. In the loan pipeline, low-risk applications flow through a (automatic approval) while high-risk ones are routed to b (manual committee review). Reasoning: The risk-based router selects exactly one mutually exclusive branch; a case flagged low-risk can never enter the high-risk branch and vice-versa, so no single run contains both a and b.\n2. At checkout a customer must choose either a (credit-card payment) or b (cash-on-delivery); the payment gateway disables the unselected option. Reasoning: The UI enforces a single-selection radio button and downstream code validates one—and only one—payment type, ensuring the two activities never co-appear in the same order.\n3. Regulations permit a sample to be processed via a (wet-lab chemical protocol) for liquid specimens or b (dry-lab bioinformatics) for genomic data, explicitly banning mixed handling. Reasoning: Compliance software validates specimen type before queuing the job and rejects any attempt to schedule the alternate protocol, so a single specimen workflow can contain only one of the two.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Borderline loan applications first undergo a (automated scoring) and then proceed to b (manual credit-committee review) before a decision is issued. Reasoning: A single borderline application clearly contains the sequence a → b, so both activities occur together.\n2. For VIP travel bookings, the system performs a (automatic ticket issuance) while simultaneously dispatching b (manual travel-agent confirmation) as an extra layer of service. Reasoning: Each VIP booking spawns both automated and manual tasks, so a and b co-exist in the same booking workflow.\n3. When a customer changes address on an open order, support runs a (address verification) and then launches b (fraud re-check) within the same service call. Reasoning: The single service request explicitly chains a and b together.\n\nNotSuccession(a,b): b cannot occur after a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The customer-complaint workflow finishes with a (final client sign-off); when that step is saved the ticket auto-closes, making b (internal escalation) impossible afterwards. Reasoning: Activity a terminates the case, so no subsequent task—including b—can be executed.\n2. During checkout, b (fraud screening) is run before payment capture, and once a (payment capture) succeeds the order is locked from further screening. Reasoning: b is always completed earlier in the timeline; after a, the lock prevents any new b event.\n3. In emergency releases, committing a (force merge to main) marks CI job b (code linting) as ‘skipped’ and locks the pipeline. Reasoning: The status change blocks b from running after the merge.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Auditors record a (preliminary sign-off) and then launch b (final compliance audit) to complete the dossier. Reasoning: The workflow explicitly places b after a, proving the forbidden order can occur.\n2. The emergency-release pipeline performs a (force deploy) and only afterwards runs b (post-deploy regression tests). Reasoning: A single deployment run contains a first and b later, so b follows a.\n3. The warehouse seals pallets with a (shipment sealing) and later performs b (random quality-inspection pulls) before loading the truck. Reasoning: Quality inspections b are scheduled chronologically after pallet sealing a.\n\nRespondedExistence(a,b): If a occurs in the trace, then b occurs as well. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1.

Only return a single valid JSON object exactly like this.**\n{\n  \"constraints\": [\n    {\n      \"template\": \"Response\",\n      \"parameters\": [[\"a\"], [\"b\"]]\n    },\n    {\n      \"template\": \"AtMost1\",\n      \"parameters\": [[\"c\"]]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nSupported Templates:\nConsider only the following declarative constraint definitions where a, b, c, and d are activities and template example-template(x,y) specifies a template named \"example-template\" and x and y can be one of the activities from the set of all activities. The supported declarative constraint templates in our framework are:\n- AtMost1(a)\n- AtLeast1(a)\n- Response(a, b)\n- Precedence(a, b)\n- CoExistence(a, b)\n- NotCoExistence(a, b)\n- NotSuccession(a, b)\n- RespondedExistence(a, b)\n** Only use these templates. Do not invent new ones or use logical operators like “or”. **\n\n\nSome more instructions:\nIt is not possible to generate constraints like Response(a, (b or c)). The first and second elements must be a single activity\nIf several valid constraints refer to the same activities, keep only the most restrictive one. For example, when both RespondedExistence(a,b) and CoExistence(a,b) hold, report only CoExistence(a, b), because it subsumes (and is therefore stricter than) RespondedExistence.\n\n\nInteraction Protocol\nWhen you receive a new input:\n1) You may write reasoning steps (internally) before producing the JSON object — but never include them in the output.\n2) Once confident, generate and return the JSON object containing the constraints.\n3) Do not include explanation or commentary in the output.\n\n\nSome examples to learn the constraints and reasoning better:\nAtMost1(a): a occurs at most once. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Activity a may appear only as the final step of the project. Reasoning: Because a project has exactly one last step, a cannot be repeated.\n2. Completing activity a requires a single-use safety clearance that can be issued only once per project. Reasoning: Once the unique clearance is consumed, a second a cannot obtain it, so no second occurrence is legal.\n3. The project terminates immediately once activity a has been executed. Reasoning: Ending the schedule right after a leaves no remaining time slots in which another a could happen.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. The maintenance routine begins with a, proceeds through b and c, and then repeats a before concluding with d. Reasoning: a appears both at the start and again before the end—two occurrences.\n2. Every four-hour production cycle executes the sequence a, b, c; the plant runs three such cycles per day. Reasoning: Each cycle contains an a, so the day’s schedule contains a three separate times.\n3. The curriculum covers unit a in week 1 and revisits unit a for advanced exercises in week 4. Reasoning: The same activity a is taught twice in the single course timeline.\n\n\nAtLeast1(a): a occurs at least once, which means the existance of activity a is mandatory. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every case begins with activity a for baseline approval before any other work may proceed. Reasoning: The word “begins” makes a the very first step of every project run, guaranteeing one occurrence.\n2. In each instance, teams must perform activity a to certify the data set’s integrity. Reasoning: Filing the report is part of the process, and a is declared a mandatory predecessor, so at least one a precedes filing.\n3. Any customer-service ticket is automatically routed to a (triage) before it can enter the resolution queue. Reasoning: Since tickets must pass through the queue to be resolved, each ticket necessarily triggers one execution of a.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. When an order arrives with a pre-approved credit flag, the workflow jumps straight to b for planning and never calls a. Reasoning: The conditional branch bypasses a entirely whenever the flag is present, so some executions contain zero a’s.\n2. During off-season maintenance, technicians may optionally perform a or proceed directly to c if no calibration is needed. Reasoning: Because a is labeled ‘optional,’ a valid path exists in which the technicians skip it.\n3. A legacy integration still routes certain tickets directly to c, bypassing a and b altogether. Reasoning: Tickets entering through the legacy path never encounter a, violating the mandatory-presence requirement.\n\n\nResponse(a,b): If a occurs, then b occurs after a.\nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Each new client request triggers a for intake, followed immediately by b for verification before any other tasks may start. Reasoning: a is hard-coded to be immediately succeeded by b; no branch exists between them, so every time a appears, b necessarily follows.\n2. In the onboarding pipeline, once a (collecting identity documents) completes, the workflow engine automatically schedules b (identity validation) as the very next step. Reasoning: The engine inserts b right after a without user discretion, eliminating any path where a occurs and b does not.\n3. For every premium order, a (fraud screening) is executed and, upon success, the system proceeds to b (payment capture) before shipping. Reasoning: The success path from a programmatically advances to b; orders cannot ship (the process goal) until b completes, so a ➔ b is enforced.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-checkout flow, the system executes a (payment capture) and ships the order immediately, skipping the fraud-review step b. Reasoning: A occurs, but b never happens, so the implication fails.\n2. During a critical-outage fix, engineers apply a (hot patch) and close the incident log without performing the normal post-patch verification b. Reasoning: The emergency path lets the process end with a but without a subsequent b.\n3. For VIP passengers, security screening b is completed pre-flight, and if an ID issue arises later, staff perform a secondary identity swipe a right at the gate. Reasoning: Here b occurs before a, not after it, breaking the required order.\n\n\nPrecedence(a,b): b occurs only if preceded by a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The manufacturing line enables b (packaging) only after a sensor logs a (final assembly complete). Reasoning: The control logic keeps the packaging station disabled until the assembly-complete flag from a is present, so every time b runs an earlier a must already have finished.\n2. Within the insurance-claims app, b (payout) can be triggered solely when the system finds a prior a (manager approval) entry for that claim. Reasoning: The trigger condition for b is the existence of an approval record; consequently, whenever b happens the claim’s history necessarily contains a preceding a. \n3. The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete. Reasoning: The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-refund path, an agent can execute b (instant payout) with a supervisor override even when a (fraud check) has not been run. Reasoning: The override permits b to happen in runs where a never took place, so b is not guaranteed to be preceded by a.\n2. During a critical-outage hot-fix, engineers deploy the patch (b) first and run the automated test suite (a) only afterward if time allows. Reasoning: Here b occurs before or even without a, breaking the ‘preceded-by’ requirement.\n3. In urgent onboarding, IT provisions the account (b) while HR finishes creating the employee record (a) the next day. Reasoning: The provisioning action b can occur one or more days before a, contradicting the rule.\n\n\nCoExistence(a,b): a and b occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every new support case triggers a (open-ticket record) and, in the same transaction, auto-creates b (initial customer-reply template). Reasoning: The system executes a composite routine that writes both database rows atomically, so whenever a is logged b is logged too, and neither appears alone.\n2. For each vendor purchase, the ERP posts a (goods-received note) and simultaneously posts b (accounts-payable accrual) in the same commit. Reasoning: Posting logic is wrapped in a single database transaction—if either insert fails the whole transaction rolls back—therefore the system state contains both or neither.\n3. Publishing a news article executes a (content push to CDN) and b (metadata push to search index) as a locked job pair—neither job can be run in isolation. Reasoning: The deploy orchestrator groups them under one job ID; a switch disables standalone execution, guaranteeing paired occurrence.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. For micro-refunds, the agent can execute b (instant payout) while the fraud-check a is skipped. Reasoning: A valid path exists in which b occurs but a does not, so the pair does not always appear together.\n2. A legacy printer service fires b (shipping-label print) on address verification, but if inventory allocation a does not occur, the label still prints. Reasoning: The system can produce b even though a has not completed, so the two are not inseparable.\n3. When a student repeats a passed module, the registrar records a (module enrollment) but suppresses b (fee payment). Reasoning: This branch shows a without b, violating the rule.\n\n  \nNotCoExistence(a,b): a and b never occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. In the loan pipeline, low-risk applications flow through a (automatic approval) while high-risk ones are routed to b (manual committee review). Reasoning: The risk-based router selects exactly one mutually exclusive branch; a case flagged low-risk can never enter the high-risk branch and vice-versa, so no single run contains both a and b.\n2. At checkout a customer must choose either a (credit-card payment) or b (cash-on-delivery); the payment gateway disables the unselected option. Reasoning: The UI enforces a single-selection radio button and downstream code validates one—and only one—payment type, ensuring the two activities never co-appear in the same order.\n3. Regulations permit a sample to be processed via a (wet-lab chemical protocol) for liquid specimens or b (dry-lab bioinformatics) for genomic data, explicitly banning mixed handling. Reasoning: Compliance software validates specimen type before queuing the job and rejects any attempt to schedule the alternate protocol, so a single specimen workflow can contain only one of the two.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Borderline loan applications first undergo a (automated scoring) and then proceed to b (manual credit-committee review) before a decision is issued. Reasoning: A single borderline application clearly contains the sequence a → b, so both activities occur together.\n2. For VIP travel bookings, the system performs a (automatic ticket issuance) while simultaneously dispatching b (manual travel-agent confirmation) as an extra layer of service. Reasoning: Each VIP booking spawns both automated and manual tasks, so a and b co-exist in the same booking workflow.\n3. When a customer changes address on an open order, support runs a (address verification) and then launches b (fraud re-check) within the same service call. Reasoning: The single service request explicitly chains a and b together.\n\nNotSuccession(a,b): b cannot occur after a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The customer-complaint workflow finishes with a (final client sign-off); when that step is saved the ticket auto-closes, making b (internal escalation) impossible afterwards. Reasoning: Activity a terminates the case, so no subsequent task—including b—can be executed.\n2. During checkout, b (fraud screening) is run before payment capture, and once a (payment capture) succeeds the order is locked from further screening. Reasoning: b is always completed earlier in the timeline; after a, the lock prevents any new b event.\n3. In emergency releases, committing a (force merge to main) marks CI job b (code linting) as ‘skipped’ and locks the pipeline. Reasoning: The status change blocks b from running after the merge.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Auditors record a (preliminary sign-off) and then launch b (final compliance audit) to complete the dossier. Reasoning: The workflow explicitly places b after a, proving the forbidden order can occur.\n2. The emergency-release pipeline performs a (force deploy) and only afterwards runs b (post-deploy regression tests). Reasoning: A single deployment run contains a first and b later, so b follows a.\n3. The warehouse seals pallets with a (shipment sealing) and later performs b (random quality-inspection pulls) before loading the truck. Reasoning: Quality inspections b are scheduled chronologically after pallet sealing a.\n\nRespondedExistence(a,b): If a occurs in the trace, then b occurs as well. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Any training session that records a (hands-on lab) must also show b (theory module) on the same attendance sheet. Reasoning: The attendance sheet is invalid without entries for both modules; thus a session containing a always contains b, with order left to the organizer.\n2. Every incident record that contains a (temporary workaround) is required by policy to include b (permanent resolution) in the same incident file. Reasoning: The data model treats the pair as mandatory fields on the same record; whichever is entered first, the other must exist before closure, so any trace with a inevitably contains b, but timing is flexible.\n3. If a sprint backlog includes a (security epic), governance checks confirm that b (pen-test task) is also on the board. Reasoning: Board validation happens at sprint start and end, ensuring both items co-appear even though teams pick their own ordering.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the quick-refund lane, an agent can execute a (issue refund) and close the ticket, while b (root-cause investigation) is marked ‘optional’ and often skipped. Reasoning: A legitimate trace exists where a is present and b never appears, contradicting the implication.\n2.

Only return a single valid JSON object exactly like this.**\n{\n  \"constraints\": [\n    {\n      \"template\": \"Response\",\n      \"parameters\": [[\"a\"], [\"b\"]]\n    },\n    {\n      \"template\": \"AtMost1\",\n      \"parameters\": [[\"c\"]]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nSupported Templates:\nConsider only the following declarative constraint definitions where a, b, c, and d are activities and template example-template(x,y) specifies a template named \"example-template\" and x and y can be one of the activities from the set of all activities. The supported declarative constraint templates in our framework are:\n- AtMost1(a)\n- AtLeast1(a)\n- Response(a, b)\n- Precedence(a, b)\n- CoExistence(a, b)\n- NotCoExistence(a, b)\n- NotSuccession(a, b)\n- RespondedExistence(a, b)\n** Only use these templates. Do not invent new ones or use logical operators like “or”. **\n\n\nSome more instructions:\nIt is not possible to generate constraints like Response(a, (b or c)). The first and second elements must be a single activity\nIf several valid constraints refer to the same activities, keep only the most restrictive one. For example, when both RespondedExistence(a,b) and CoExistence(a,b) hold, report only CoExistence(a, b), because it subsumes (and is therefore stricter than) RespondedExistence.\n\n\nInteraction Protocol\nWhen you receive a new input:\n1) You may write reasoning steps (internally) before producing the JSON object — but never include them in the output.\n2) Once confident, generate and return the JSON object containing the constraints.\n3) Do not include explanation or commentary in the output.\n\n\nSome examples to learn the constraints and reasoning better:\nAtMost1(a): a occurs at most once. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Activity a may appear only as the final step of the project. Reasoning: Because a project has exactly one last step, a cannot be repeated.\n2. Completing activity a requires a single-use safety clearance that can be issued only once per project. Reasoning: Once the unique clearance is consumed, a second a cannot obtain it, so no second occurrence is legal.\n3. The project terminates immediately once activity a has been executed. Reasoning: Ending the schedule right after a leaves no remaining time slots in which another a could happen.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. The maintenance routine begins with a, proceeds through b and c, and then repeats a before concluding with d. Reasoning: a appears both at the start and again before the end—two occurrences.\n2. Every four-hour production cycle executes the sequence a, b, c; the plant runs three such cycles per day. Reasoning: Each cycle contains an a, so the day’s schedule contains a three separate times.\n3. The curriculum covers unit a in week 1 and revisits unit a for advanced exercises in week 4. Reasoning: The same activity a is taught twice in the single course timeline.\n\n\nAtLeast1(a): a occurs at least once, which means the existance of activity a is mandatory. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every case begins with activity a for baseline approval before any other work may proceed. Reasoning: The word “begins” makes a the very first step of every project run, guaranteeing one occurrence.\n2. In each instance, teams must perform activity a to certify the data set’s integrity. Reasoning: Filing the report is part of the process, and a is declared a mandatory predecessor, so at least one a precedes filing.\n3. Any customer-service ticket is automatically routed to a (triage) before it can enter the resolution queue. Reasoning: Since tickets must pass through the queue to be resolved, each ticket necessarily triggers one execution of a.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. When an order arrives with a pre-approved credit flag, the workflow jumps straight to b for planning and never calls a. Reasoning: The conditional branch bypasses a entirely whenever the flag is present, so some executions contain zero a’s.\n2. During off-season maintenance, technicians may optionally perform a or proceed directly to c if no calibration is needed. Reasoning: Because a is labeled ‘optional,’ a valid path exists in which the technicians skip it.\n3. A legacy integration still routes certain tickets directly to c, bypassing a and b altogether. Reasoning: Tickets entering through the legacy path never encounter a, violating the mandatory-presence requirement.\n\n\nResponse(a,b): If a occurs, then b occurs after a.\nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Each new client request triggers a for intake, followed immediately by b for verification before any other tasks may start. Reasoning: a is hard-coded to be immediately succeeded by b; no branch exists between them, so every time a appears, b necessarily follows.\n2. In the onboarding pipeline, once a (collecting identity documents) completes, the workflow engine automatically schedules b (identity validation) as the very next step. Reasoning: The engine inserts b right after a without user discretion, eliminating any path where a occurs and b does not.\n3. For every premium order, a (fraud screening) is executed and, upon success, the system proceeds to b (payment capture) before shipping. Reasoning: The success path from a programmatically advances to b; orders cannot ship (the process goal) until b completes, so a ➔ b is enforced.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-checkout flow, the system executes a (payment capture) and ships the order immediately, skipping the fraud-review step b. Reasoning: A occurs, but b never happens, so the implication fails.\n2. During a critical-outage fix, engineers apply a (hot patch) and close the incident log without performing the normal post-patch verification b. Reasoning: The emergency path lets the process end with a but without a subsequent b.\n3. For VIP passengers, security screening b is completed pre-flight, and if an ID issue arises later, staff perform a secondary identity swipe a right at the gate. Reasoning: Here b occurs before a, not after it, breaking the required order.\n\n\nPrecedence(a,b): b occurs only if preceded by a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The manufacturing line enables b (packaging) only after a sensor logs a (final assembly complete). Reasoning: The control logic keeps the packaging station disabled until the assembly-complete flag from a is present, so every time b runs an earlier a must already have finished.\n2. Within the insurance-claims app, b (payout) can be triggered solely when the system finds a prior a (manager approval) entry for that claim. Reasoning: The trigger condition for b is the existence of an approval record; consequently, whenever b happens the claim’s history necessarily contains a preceding a. \n3. The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete. Reasoning: The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-refund path, an agent can execute b (instant payout) with a supervisor override even when a (fraud check) has not been run. Reasoning: The override permits b to happen in runs where a never took place, so b is not guaranteed to be preceded by a.\n2. During a critical-outage hot-fix, engineers deploy the patch (b) first and run the automated test suite (a) only afterward if time allows. Reasoning: Here b occurs before or even without a, breaking the ‘preceded-by’ requirement.\n3. In urgent onboarding, IT provisions the account (b) while HR finishes creating the employee record (a) the next day. Reasoning: The provisioning action b can occur one or more days before a, contradicting the rule.\n\n\nCoExistence(a,b): a and b occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every new support case triggers a (open-ticket record) and, in the same transaction, auto-creates b (initial customer-reply template). Reasoning: The system executes a composite routine that writes both database rows atomically, so whenever a is logged b is logged too, and neither appears alone.\n2. For each vendor purchase, the ERP posts a (goods-received note) and simultaneously posts b (accounts-payable accrual) in the same commit. Reasoning: Posting logic is wrapped in a single database transaction—if either insert fails the whole transaction rolls back—therefore the system state contains both or neither.\n3. Publishing a news article executes a (content push to CDN) and b (metadata push to search index) as a locked job pair—neither job can be run in isolation. Reasoning: The deploy orchestrator groups them under one job ID; a switch disables standalone execution, guaranteeing paired occurrence.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. For micro-refunds, the agent can execute b (instant payout) while the fraud-check a is skipped. Reasoning: A valid path exists in which b occurs but a does not, so the pair does not always appear together.\n2. A legacy printer service fires b (shipping-label print) on address verification, but if inventory allocation a does not occur, the label still prints. Reasoning: The system can produce b even though a has not completed, so the two are not inseparable.\n3. When a student repeats a passed module, the registrar records a (module enrollment) but suppresses b (fee payment). Reasoning: This branch shows a without b, violating the rule.\n\n  \nNotCoExistence(a,b): a and b never occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. In the loan pipeline, low-risk applications flow through a (automatic approval) while high-risk ones are routed to b (manual committee review). Reasoning: The risk-based router selects exactly one mutually exclusive branch; a case flagged low-risk can never enter the high-risk branch and vice-versa, so no single run contains both a and b.\n2. At checkout a customer must choose either a (credit-card payment) or b (cash-on-delivery); the payment gateway disables the unselected option. Reasoning: The UI enforces a single-selection radio button and downstream code validates one—and only one—payment type, ensuring the two activities never co-appear in the same order.\n3. Regulations permit a sample to be processed via a (wet-lab chemical protocol) for liquid specimens or b (dry-lab bioinformatics) for genomic data, explicitly banning mixed handling. Reasoning: Compliance software validates specimen type before queuing the job and rejects any attempt to schedule the alternate protocol, so a single specimen workflow can contain only one of the two.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Borderline loan applications first undergo a (automated scoring) and then proceed to b (manual credit-committee review) before a decision is issued. Reasoning: A single borderline application clearly contains the sequence a → b, so both activities occur together.\n2. For VIP travel bookings, the system performs a (automatic ticket issuance) while simultaneously dispatching b (manual travel-agent confirmation) as an extra layer of service. Reasoning: Each VIP booking spawns both automated and manual tasks, so a and b co-exist in the same booking workflow.\n3. When a customer changes address on an open order, support runs a (address verification) and then launches b (fraud re-check) within the same service call. Reasoning: The single service request explicitly chains a and b together.\n\nNotSuccession(a,b): b cannot occur after a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The customer-complaint workflow finishes with a (final client sign-off); when that step is saved the ticket auto-closes, making b (internal escalation) impossible afterwards. Reasoning: Activity a terminates the case, so no subsequent task—including b—can be executed.\n2. During checkout, b (fraud screening) is run before payment capture, and once a (payment capture) succeeds the order is locked from further screening. Reasoning: b is always completed earlier in the timeline; after a, the lock prevents any new b event.\n3. In emergency releases, committing a (force merge to main) marks CI job b (code linting) as ‘skipped’ and locks the pipeline. Reasoning: The status change blocks b from running after the merge.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Auditors record a (preliminary sign-off) and then launch b (final compliance audit) to complete the dossier. Reasoning: The workflow explicitly places b after a, proving the forbidden order can occur.\n2. The emergency-release pipeline performs a (force deploy) and only afterwards runs b (post-deploy regression tests). Reasoning: A single deployment run contains a first and b later, so b follows a.\n3. The warehouse seals pallets with a (shipment sealing) and later performs b (random quality-inspection pulls) before loading the truck. Reasoning: Quality inspections b are scheduled chronologically after pallet sealing a.\n\nRespondedExistence(a,b): If a occurs in the trace, then b occurs as well. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Any training session that records a (hands-on lab) must also show b (theory module) on the same attendance sheet. Reasoning: The attendance sheet is invalid without entries for both modules; thus a session containing a always contains b, with order left to the organizer.\n2. Every incident record that contains a (temporary workaround) is required by policy to include b (permanent resolution) in the same incident file. Reasoning: The data model treats the pair as mandatory fields on the same record; whichever is entered first, the other must exist before closure, so any trace with a inevitably contains b, but timing is flexible.\n3. If a sprint backlog includes a (security epic), governance checks confirm that b (pen-test task) is also on the board. Reasoning: Board validation happens at sprint start and end, ensuring both items co-appear even though teams pick their own ordering.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the quick-refund lane, an agent can execute a (issue refund) and close the ticket, while b (root-cause investigation) is marked ‘optional’ and often skipped. Reasoning: A legitimate trace exists where a is present and b never appears, contradicting the implication.\n2. For VIP travelers, the airline auto-issues a (boarding pass) but waives b (secondary identity check) unless a random audit flag is raised. Reasoning: Many VIP traces show a without the corresponding b event.\n3. A late-stage sales opportunity logs a (verbal commitment) immediately, while b (formal contract upload) may be omitted if the deal falls through. Reasoning: When a deal collapses, the trace holds a but never records b.\n\nFor each task, I provide the set of activity labels that exist in the process.\n\n\nThe list of activities used in this process are the following. Please only use these activities to generate constraints:\nAccept Claim, Block Claim 3, Receive objection 1, Payment Order, Block Claim 2, Withdraw Claim, Execute Payment, Repayment, Block Claim 1, Correct Claim, Unblock Claim 3, Reject Claim, Receive Claim\n\nAll the accepted claims should have a payment order afterward.",

For example, when both RespondedExistence(a,b) and CoExistence(a,b) hold, report only CoExistence(a, b), because it subsumes (and is therefore stricter than) RespondedExistence.\n\n\nInteraction Protocol\nWhen you receive a new input:\n1) You may write reasoning steps (internally) before producing the JSON object — but never include them in the output.\n2) Once confident, generate and return the JSON object containing the constraints.\n3) Do not include explanation or commentary in the output.\n\n\nSome examples to learn the constraints and reasoning better:\nAtMost1(a): a occurs at most once. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Activity a may appear only as the final step of the project. Reasoning: Because a project has exactly one last step, a cannot be repeated.\n2. Completing activity a requires a single-use safety clearance that can be issued only once per project. Reasoning: Once the unique clearance is consumed, a second a cannot obtain it, so no second occurrence is legal.\n3. The project terminates immediately once activity a has been executed. Reasoning: Ending the schedule right after a leaves no remaining time slots in which another a could happen.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. The maintenance routine begins with a, proceeds through b and c, and then repeats a before concluding with d. Reasoning: a appears both at the start and again before the end—two occurrences.\n2. Every four-hour production cycle executes the sequence a, b, c; the plant runs three such cycles per day. Reasoning: Each cycle contains an a, so the day’s schedule contains a three separate times.\n3. The curriculum covers unit a in week 1 and revisits unit a for advanced exercises in week 4. Reasoning: The same activity a is taught twice in the single course timeline.\n\n\nAtLeast1(a): a occurs at least once, which means the existance of activity a is mandatory. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every case begins with activity a for baseline approval before any other work may proceed. Reasoning: The word “begins” makes a the very first step of every project run, guaranteeing one occurrence.\n2. In each instance, teams must perform activity a to certify the data set’s integrity. Reasoning: Filing the report is part of the process, and a is declared a mandatory predecessor, so at least one a precedes filing.\n3. Any customer-service ticket is automatically routed to a (triage) before it can enter the resolution queue. Reasoning: Since tickets must pass through the queue to be resolved, each ticket necessarily triggers one execution of a.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. When an order arrives with a pre-approved credit flag, the workflow jumps straight to b for planning and never calls a. Reasoning: The conditional branch bypasses a entirely whenever the flag is present, so some executions contain zero a’s.\n2. During off-season maintenance, technicians may optionally perform a or proceed directly to c if no calibration is needed. Reasoning: Because a is labeled ‘optional,’ a valid path exists in which the technicians skip it.\n3. A legacy integration still routes certain tickets directly to c, bypassing a and b altogether. Reasoning: Tickets entering through the legacy path never encounter a, violating the mandatory-presence requirement.\n\n\nResponse(a,b): If a occurs, then b occurs after a.\nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Each new client request triggers a for intake, followed immediately by b for verification before any other tasks may start. Reasoning: a is hard-coded to be immediately succeeded by b; no branch exists between them, so every time a appears, b necessarily follows.\n2. In the onboarding pipeline, once a (collecting identity documents) completes, the workflow engine automatically schedules b (identity validation) as the very next step. Reasoning: The engine inserts b right after a without user discretion, eliminating any path where a occurs and b does not.\n3. For every premium order, a (fraud screening) is executed and, upon success, the system proceeds to b (payment capture) before shipping. Reasoning: The success path from a programmatically advances to b; orders cannot ship (the process goal) until b completes, so a ➔ b is enforced.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-checkout flow, the system executes a (payment capture) and ships the order immediately, skipping the fraud-review step b. Reasoning: A occurs, but b never happens, so the implication fails.\n2. During a critical-outage fix, engineers apply a (hot patch) and close the incident log without performing the normal post-patch verification b. Reasoning: The emergency path lets the process end with a but without a subsequent b.\n3. For VIP passengers, security screening b is completed pre-flight, and if an ID issue arises later, staff perform a secondary identity swipe a right at the gate. Reasoning: Here b occurs before a, not after it, breaking the required order.\n\n\nPrecedence(a,b): b occurs only if preceded by a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The manufacturing line enables b (packaging) only after a sensor logs a (final assembly complete). Reasoning: The control logic keeps the packaging station disabled until the assembly-complete flag from a is present, so every time b runs an earlier a must already have finished.\n2. Within the insurance-claims app, b (payout) can be triggered solely when the system finds a prior a (manager approval) entry for that claim. Reasoning: The trigger condition for b is the existence of an approval record; consequently, whenever b happens the claim’s history necessarily contains a preceding a. \n3. The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete. Reasoning: The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-refund path, an agent can execute b (instant payout) with a supervisor override even when a (fraud check) has not been run. Reasoning: The override permits b to happen in runs where a never took place, so b is not guaranteed to be preceded by a.\n2. During a critical-outage hot-fix, engineers deploy the patch (b) first and run the automated test suite (a) only afterward if time allows. Reasoning: Here b occurs before or even without a, breaking the ‘preceded-by’ requirement.\n3. In urgent onboarding, IT provisions the account (b) while HR finishes creating the employee record (a) the next day. Reasoning: The provisioning action b can occur one or more days before a, contradicting the rule.\n\n\nCoExistence(a,b): a and b occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every new support case triggers a (open-ticket record) and, in the same transaction, auto-creates b (initial customer-reply template). Reasoning: The system executes a composite routine that writes both database rows atomically, so whenever a is logged b is logged too, and neither appears alone.\n2. For each vendor purchase, the ERP posts a (goods-received note) and simultaneously posts b (accounts-payable accrual) in the same commit. Reasoning: Posting logic is wrapped in a single database transaction—if either insert fails the whole transaction rolls back—therefore the system state contains both or neither.\n3. Publishing a news article executes a (content push to CDN) and b (metadata push to search index) as a locked job pair—neither job can be run in isolation. Reasoning: The deploy orchestrator groups them under one job ID; a switch disables standalone execution, guaranteeing paired occurrence.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. For micro-refunds, the agent can execute b (instant payout) while the fraud-check a is skipped. Reasoning: A valid path exists in which b occurs but a does not, so the pair does not always appear together.\n2. A legacy printer service fires b (shipping-label print) on address verification, but if inventory allocation a does not occur, the label still prints. Reasoning: The system can produce b even though a has not completed, so the two are not inseparable.\n3. When a student repeats a passed module, the registrar records a (module enrollment) but suppresses b (fee payment). Reasoning: This branch shows a without b, violating the rule.\n\n  \nNotCoExistence(a,b): a and b never occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. In the loan pipeline, low-risk applications flow through a (automatic approval) while high-risk ones are routed to b (manual committee review). Reasoning: The risk-based router selects exactly one mutually exclusive branch; a case flagged low-risk can never enter the high-risk branch and vice-versa, so no single run contains both a and b.\n2. At checkout a customer must choose either a (credit-card payment) or b (cash-on-delivery); the payment gateway disables the unselected option. Reasoning: The UI enforces a single-selection radio button and downstream code validates one—and only one—payment type, ensuring the two activities never co-appear in the same order.\n3. Regulations permit a sample to be processed via a (wet-lab chemical protocol) for liquid specimens or b (dry-lab bioinformatics) for genomic data, explicitly banning mixed handling. Reasoning: Compliance software validates specimen type before queuing the job and rejects any attempt to schedule the alternate protocol, so a single specimen workflow can contain only one of the two.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Borderline loan applications first undergo a (automated scoring) and then proceed to b (manual credit-committee review) before a decision is issued. Reasoning: A single borderline application clearly contains the sequence a → b, so both activities occur together.\n2. For VIP travel bookings, the system performs a (automatic ticket issuance) while simultaneously dispatching b (manual travel-agent confirmation) as an extra layer of service. Reasoning: Each VIP booking spawns both automated and manual tasks, so a and b co-exist in the same booking workflow.\n3. When a customer changes address on an open order, support runs a (address verification) and then launches b (fraud re-check) within the same service call. Reasoning: The single service request explicitly chains a and b together.\n\nNotSuccession(a,b): b cannot occur after a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The customer-complaint workflow finishes with a (final client sign-off); when that step is saved the ticket auto-closes, making b (internal escalation) impossible afterwards. Reasoning: Activity a terminates the case, so no subsequent task—including b—can be executed.\n2. During checkout, b (fraud screening) is run before payment capture, and once a (payment capture) succeeds the order is locked from further screening. Reasoning: b is always completed earlier in the timeline; after a, the lock prevents any new b event.\n3. In emergency releases, committing a (force merge to main) marks CI job b (code linting) as ‘skipped’ and locks the pipeline. Reasoning: The status change blocks b from running after the merge.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Auditors record a (preliminary sign-off) and then launch b (final compliance audit) to complete the dossier. Reasoning: The workflow explicitly places b after a, proving the forbidden order can occur.\n2. The emergency-release pipeline performs a (force deploy) and only afterwards runs b (post-deploy regression tests). Reasoning: A single deployment run contains a first and b later, so b follows a.\n3. The warehouse seals pallets with a (shipment sealing) and later performs b (random quality-inspection pulls) before loading the truck. Reasoning: Quality inspections b are scheduled chronologically after pallet sealing a.\n\nRespondedExistence(a,b): If a occurs in the trace, then b occurs as well. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Any training session that records a (hands-on lab) must also show b (theory module) on the same attendance sheet. Reasoning: The attendance sheet is invalid without entries for both modules; thus a session containing a always contains b, with order left to the organizer.\n2. Every incident record that contains a (temporary workaround) is required by policy to include b (permanent resolution) in the same incident file. Reasoning: The data model treats the pair as mandatory fields on the same record; whichever is entered first, the other must exist before closure, so any trace with a inevitably contains b, but timing is flexible.\n3. If a sprint backlog includes a (security epic), governance checks confirm that b (pen-test task) is also on the board. Reasoning: Board validation happens at sprint start and end, ensuring both items co-appear even though teams pick their own ordering.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the quick-refund lane, an agent can execute a (issue refund) and close the ticket, while b (root-cause investigation) is marked ‘optional’ and often skipped. Reasoning: A legitimate trace exists where a is present and b never appears, contradicting the implication.\n2. For VIP travelers, the airline auto-issues a (boarding pass) but waives b (secondary identity check) unless a random audit flag is raised. Reasoning: Many VIP traces show a without the corresponding b event.\n3. A late-stage sales opportunity logs a (verbal commitment) immediately, while b (formal contract upload) may be omitted if the deal falls through. Reasoning: When a deal collapses, the trace holds a but never records b.\n\nFor each task, I provide the set of activity labels that exist in the process.\n\n\nThe list of activities used in this process are the following.

Reasoning: The word “begins” makes a the very first step of every project run, guaranteeing one occurrence.\n2. In each instance, teams must perform activity a to certify the data set’s integrity. Reasoning: Filing the report is part of the process, and a is declared a mandatory predecessor, so at least one a precedes filing.\n3. Any customer-service ticket is automatically routed to a (triage) before it can enter the resolution queue. Reasoning: Since tickets must pass through the queue to be resolved, each ticket necessarily triggers one execution of a.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. When an order arrives with a pre-approved credit flag, the workflow jumps straight to b for planning and never calls a. Reasoning: The conditional branch bypasses a entirely whenever the flag is present, so some executions contain zero a’s.\n2. During off-season maintenance, technicians may optionally perform a or proceed directly to c if no calibration is needed. Reasoning: Because a is labeled ‘optional,’ a valid path exists in which the technicians skip it.\n3. A legacy integration still routes certain tickets directly to c, bypassing a and b altogether. Reasoning: Tickets entering through the legacy path never encounter a, violating the mandatory-presence requirement.\n\n\nResponse(a,b): If a occurs, then b occurs after a.\nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Each new client request triggers a for intake, followed immediately by b for verification before any other tasks may start. Reasoning: a is hard-coded to be immediately succeeded by b; no branch exists between them, so every time a appears, b necessarily follows.\n2. In the onboarding pipeline, once a (collecting identity documents) completes, the workflow engine automatically schedules b (identity validation) as the very next step. Reasoning: The engine inserts b right after a without user discretion, eliminating any path where a occurs and b does not.\n3. For every premium order, a (fraud screening) is executed and, upon success, the system proceeds to b (payment capture) before shipping. Reasoning: The success path from a programmatically advances to b; orders cannot ship (the process goal) until b completes, so a ➔ b is enforced.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-checkout flow, the system executes a (payment capture) and ships the order immediately, skipping the fraud-review step b. Reasoning: A occurs, but b never happens, so the implication fails.\n2. During a critical-outage fix, engineers apply a (hot patch) and close the incident log without performing the normal post-patch verification b. Reasoning: The emergency path lets the process end with a but without a subsequent b.\n3. For VIP passengers, security screening b is completed pre-flight, and if an ID issue arises later, staff perform a secondary identity swipe a right at the gate. Reasoning: Here b occurs before a, not after it, breaking the required order.\n\n\nPrecedence(a,b): b occurs only if preceded by a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The manufacturing line enables b (packaging) only after a sensor logs a (final assembly complete). Reasoning: The control logic keeps the packaging station disabled until the assembly-complete flag from a is present, so every time b runs an earlier a must already have finished.\n2. Within the insurance-claims app, b (payout) can be triggered solely when the system finds a prior a (manager approval) entry for that claim. Reasoning: The trigger condition for b is the existence of an approval record; consequently, whenever b happens the claim’s history necessarily contains a preceding a. \n3. The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete. Reasoning: The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-refund path, an agent can execute b (instant payout) with a supervisor override even when a (fraud check) has not been run. Reasoning: The override permits b to happen in runs where a never took place, so b is not guaranteed to be preceded by a.\n2. During a critical-outage hot-fix, engineers deploy the patch (b) first and run the automated test suite (a) only afterward if time allows. Reasoning: Here b occurs before or even without a, breaking the ‘preceded-by’ requirement.\n3. In urgent onboarding, IT provisions the account (b) while HR finishes creating the employee record (a) the next day. Reasoning: The provisioning action b can occur one or more days before a, contradicting the rule.\n\n\nCoExistence(a,b): a and b occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every new support case triggers a (open-ticket record) and, in the same transaction, auto-creates b (initial customer-reply template). Reasoning: The system executes a composite routine that writes both database rows atomically, so whenever a is logged b is logged too, and neither appears alone.\n2. For each vendor purchase, the ERP posts a (goods-received note) and simultaneously posts b (accounts-payable accrual) in the same commit. Reasoning: Posting logic is wrapped in a single database transaction—if either insert fails the whole transaction rolls back—therefore the system state contains both or neither.\n3. Publishing a news article executes a (content push to CDN) and b (metadata push to search index) as a locked job pair—neither job can be run in isolation. Reasoning: The deploy orchestrator groups them under one job ID; a switch disables standalone execution, guaranteeing paired occurrence.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. For micro-refunds, the agent can execute b (instant payout) while the fraud-check a is skipped. Reasoning: A valid path exists in which b occurs but a does not, so the pair does not always appear together.\n2. A legacy printer service fires b (shipping-label print) on address verification, but if inventory allocation a does not occur, the label still prints. Reasoning: The system can produce b even though a has not completed, so the two are not inseparable.\n3. When a student repeats a passed module, the registrar records a (module enrollment) but suppresses b (fee payment). Reasoning: This branch shows a without b, violating the rule.\n\n  \nNotCoExistence(a,b): a and b never occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. In the loan pipeline, low-risk applications flow through a (automatic approval) while high-risk ones are routed to b (manual committee review). Reasoning: The risk-based router selects exactly one mutually exclusive branch; a case flagged low-risk can never enter the high-risk branch and vice-versa, so no single run contains both a and b.\n2. At checkout a customer must choose either a (credit-card payment) or b (cash-on-delivery); the payment gateway disables the unselected option. Reasoning: The UI enforces a single-selection radio button and downstream code validates one—and only one—payment type, ensuring the two activities never co-appear in the same order.\n3. Regulations permit a sample to be processed via a (wet-lab chemical protocol) for liquid specimens or b (dry-lab bioinformatics) for genomic data, explicitly banning mixed handling. Reasoning: Compliance software validates specimen type before queuing the job and rejects any attempt to schedule the alternate protocol, so a single specimen workflow can contain only one of the two.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Borderline loan applications first undergo a (automated scoring) and then proceed to b (manual credit-committee review) before a decision is issued. Reasoning: A single borderline application clearly contains the sequence a → b, so both activities occur together.\n2. For VIP travel bookings, the system performs a (automatic ticket issuance) while simultaneously dispatching b (manual travel-agent confirmation) as an extra layer of service. Reasoning: Each VIP booking spawns both automated and manual tasks, so a and b co-exist in the same booking workflow.\n3. When a customer changes address on an open order, support runs a (address verification) and then launches b (fraud re-check) within the same service call. Reasoning: The single service request explicitly chains a and b together.\n\nNotSuccession(a,b): b cannot occur after a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The customer-complaint workflow finishes with a (final client sign-off); when that step is saved the ticket auto-closes, making b (internal escalation) impossible afterwards. Reasoning: Activity a terminates the case, so no subsequent task—including b—can be executed.\n2. During checkout, b (fraud screening) is run before payment capture, and once a (payment capture) succeeds the order is locked from further screening. Reasoning: b is always completed earlier in the timeline; after a, the lock prevents any new b event.\n3. In emergency releases, committing a (force merge to main) marks CI job b (code linting) as ‘skipped’ and locks the pipeline. Reasoning: The status change blocks b from running after the merge.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Auditors record a (preliminary sign-off) and then launch b (final compliance audit) to complete the dossier. Reasoning: The workflow explicitly places b after a, proving the forbidden order can occur.\n2. The emergency-release pipeline performs a (force deploy) and only afterwards runs b (post-deploy regression tests). Reasoning: A single deployment run contains a first and b later, so b follows a.\n3. The warehouse seals pallets with a (shipment sealing) and later performs b (random quality-inspection pulls) before loading the truck. Reasoning: Quality inspections b are scheduled chronologically after pallet sealing a.\n\nRespondedExistence(a,b): If a occurs in the trace, then b occurs as well. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Any training session that records a (hands-on lab) must also show b (theory module) on the same attendance sheet. Reasoning: The attendance sheet is invalid without entries for both modules; thus a session containing a always contains b, with order left to the organizer.\n2. Every incident record that contains a (temporary workaround) is required by policy to include b (permanent resolution) in the same incident file. Reasoning: The data model treats the pair as mandatory fields on the same record; whichever is entered first, the other must exist before closure, so any trace with a inevitably contains b, but timing is flexible.\n3. If a sprint backlog includes a (security epic), governance checks confirm that b (pen-test task) is also on the board. Reasoning: Board validation happens at sprint start and end, ensuring both items co-appear even though teams pick their own ordering.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the quick-refund lane, an agent can execute a (issue refund) and close the ticket, while b (root-cause investigation) is marked ‘optional’ and often skipped. Reasoning: A legitimate trace exists where a is present and b never appears, contradicting the implication.\n2. For VIP travelers, the airline auto-issues a (boarding pass) but waives b (secondary identity check) unless a random audit flag is raised. Reasoning: Many VIP traces show a without the corresponding b event.\n3. A late-stage sales opportunity logs a (verbal commitment) immediately, while b (formal contract upload) may be omitted if the deal falls through. Reasoning: When a deal collapses, the trace holds a but never records b.\n\nFor each task, I provide the set of activity labels that exist in the process.\n\n\nThe list of activities used in this process are the following. Please only use these activities to generate constraints:\nO_Accepted, A_Cancelled, A_Pending, A_Validating, O_Sent (online only), A_Denied, A_Accepted, O_Sent (mail and online), A_Complete, O_Create Offer, A_Incomplete, A_Submitted\n\nWe may have a maximum of one application pending event.",

Completing activity a requires a single-use safety clearance that can be issued only once per project. Reasoning: Once the unique clearance is consumed, a second a cannot obtain it, so no second occurrence is legal.\n3. The project terminates immediately once activity a has been executed.

Reasoning: The success path from a programmatically advances to b; orders cannot ship (the process goal) until b completes, so a ➔ b is enforced.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-checkout flow, the system executes a (payment capture) and ships the order immediately, skipping the fraud-review step b. Reasoning: A occurs, but b never happens, so the implication fails.\n2. During a critical-outage fix, engineers apply a (hot patch) and close the incident log without performing the normal post-patch verification b. Reasoning: The emergency path lets the process end with a but without a subsequent b.\n3. For VIP passengers, security screening b is completed pre-flight, and if an ID issue arises later, staff perform a secondary identity swipe a right at the gate. Reasoning: Here b occurs before a, not after it, breaking the required order.\n\n\nPrecedence(a,b): b occurs only if preceded by a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The manufacturing line enables b (packaging) only after a sensor logs a (final assembly complete). Reasoning: The control logic keeps the packaging station disabled until the assembly-complete flag from a is present, so every time b runs an earlier a must already have finished.\n2. Within the insurance-claims app, b (payout) can be triggered solely when the system finds a prior a (manager approval) entry for that claim. Reasoning: The trigger condition for b is the existence of an approval record; consequently, whenever b happens the claim’s history necessarily contains a preceding a. \n3. The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete. Reasoning: The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-refund path, an agent can execute b (instant payout) with a supervisor override even when a (fraud check) has not been run. Reasoning: The override permits b to happen in runs where a never took place, so b is not guaranteed to be preceded by a.\n2. During a critical-outage hot-fix, engineers deploy the patch (b) first and run the automated test suite (a) only afterward if time allows. Reasoning: Here b occurs before or even without a, breaking the ‘preceded-by’ requirement.\n3. In urgent onboarding, IT provisions the account (b) while HR finishes creating the employee record (a) the next day. Reasoning: The provisioning action b can occur one or more days before a, contradicting the rule.\n\n\nCoExistence(a,b): a and b occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every new support case triggers a (open-ticket record) and, in the same transaction, auto-creates b (initial customer-reply template). Reasoning: The system executes a composite routine that writes both database rows atomically, so whenever a is logged b is logged too, and neither appears alone.\n2. For each vendor purchase, the ERP posts a (goods-received note) and simultaneously posts b (accounts-payable accrual) in the same commit. Reasoning: Posting logic is wrapped in a single database transaction—if either insert fails the whole transaction rolls back—therefore the system state contains both or neither.\n3. Publishing a news article executes a (content push to CDN) and b (metadata push to search index) as a locked job pair—neither job can be run in isolation. Reasoning: The deploy orchestrator groups them under one job ID; a switch disables standalone execution, guaranteeing paired occurrence.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. For micro-refunds, the agent can execute b (instant payout) while the fraud-check a is skipped. Reasoning: A valid path exists in which b occurs but a does not, so the pair does not always appear together.\n2. A legacy printer service fires b (shipping-label print) on address verification, but if inventory allocation a does not occur, the label still prints. Reasoning: The system can produce b even though a has not completed, so the two are not inseparable.\n3. When a student repeats a passed module, the registrar records a (module enrollment) but suppresses b (fee payment). Reasoning: This branch shows a without b, violating the rule.\n\n  \nNotCoExistence(a,b): a and b never occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. In the loan pipeline, low-risk applications flow through a (automatic approval) while high-risk ones are routed to b (manual committee review). Reasoning: The risk-based router selects exactly one mutually exclusive branch; a case flagged low-risk can never enter the high-risk branch and vice-versa, so no single run contains both a and b.\n2. At checkout a customer must choose either a (credit-card payment) or b (cash-on-delivery); the payment gateway disables the unselected option. Reasoning: The UI enforces a single-selection radio button and downstream code validates one—and only one—payment type, ensuring the two activities never co-appear in the same order.\n3. Regulations permit a sample to be processed via a (wet-lab chemical protocol) for liquid specimens or b (dry-lab bioinformatics) for genomic data, explicitly banning mixed handling. Reasoning: Compliance software validates specimen type before queuing the job and rejects any attempt to schedule the alternate protocol, so a single specimen workflow can contain only one of the two.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Borderline loan applications first undergo a (automated scoring) and then proceed to b (manual credit-committee review) before a decision is issued. Reasoning: A single borderline application clearly contains the sequence a → b, so both activities occur together.\n2. For VIP travel bookings, the system performs a (automatic ticket issuance) while simultaneously dispatching b (manual travel-agent confirmation) as an extra layer of service. Reasoning: Each VIP booking spawns both automated and manual tasks, so a and b co-exist in the same booking workflow.\n3. When a customer changes address on an open order, support runs a (address verification) and then launches b (fraud re-check) within the same service call. Reasoning: The single service request explicitly chains a and b together.\n\nNotSuccession(a,b): b cannot occur after a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The customer-complaint workflow finishes with a (final client sign-off); when that step is saved the ticket auto-closes, making b (internal escalation) impossible afterwards. Reasoning: Activity a terminates the case, so no subsequent task—including b—can be executed.\n2. During checkout, b (fraud screening) is run before payment capture, and once a (payment capture) succeeds the order is locked from further screening. Reasoning: b is always completed earlier in the timeline; after a, the lock prevents any new b event.\n3. In emergency releases, committing a (force merge to main) marks CI job b (code linting) as ‘skipped’ and locks the pipeline. Reasoning: The status change blocks b from running after the merge.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Auditors record a (preliminary sign-off) and then launch b (final compliance audit) to complete the dossier. Reasoning: The workflow explicitly places b after a, proving the forbidden order can occur.\n2. The emergency-release pipeline performs a (force deploy) and only afterwards runs b (post-deploy regression tests). Reasoning: A single deployment run contains a first and b later, so b follows a.\n3. The warehouse seals pallets with a (shipment sealing) and later performs b (random quality-inspection pulls) before loading the truck. Reasoning: Quality inspections b are scheduled chronologically after pallet sealing a.\n\nRespondedExistence(a,b): If a occurs in the trace, then b occurs as well. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Any training session that records a (hands-on lab) must also show b (theory module) on the same attendance sheet. Reasoning: The attendance sheet is invalid without entries for both modules; thus a session containing a always contains b, with order left to the organizer.\n2. Every incident record that contains a (temporary workaround) is required by policy to include b (permanent resolution) in the same incident file. Reasoning: The data model treats the pair as mandatory fields on the same record; whichever is entered first, the other must exist before closure, so any trace with a inevitably contains b, but timing is flexible.\n3. If a sprint backlog includes a (security epic), governance checks confirm that b (pen-test task) is also on the board. Reasoning: Board validation happens at sprint start and end, ensuring both items co-appear even though teams pick their own ordering.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the quick-refund lane, an agent can execute a (issue refund) and close the ticket, while b (root-cause investigation) is marked ‘optional’ and often skipped. Reasoning: A legitimate trace exists where a is present and b never appears, contradicting the implication.\n2. For VIP travelers, the airline auto-issues a (boarding pass) but waives b (secondary identity check) unless a random audit flag is raised. Reasoning: Many VIP traces show a without the corresponding b event.\n3. A late-stage sales opportunity logs a (verbal commitment) immediately, while b (formal contract upload) may be omitted if the deal falls through. Reasoning: When a deal collapses, the trace holds a but never records b.\n\nFor each task, I provide the set of activity labels that exist in the process.\n\n\nThe list of activities used in this process are the following. Please only use these activities to generate constraints:\nO_Accepted, A_Cancelled, A_Pending, A_Validating, O_Sent (online only), A_Denied, A_Accepted, O_Sent (mail and online), A_Complete, O_Create Offer, A_Incomplete, A_Submitted\n\nAn application can either be cancelled or denied.",

The supported declarative constraint templates in our framework are:\n- AtMost1(a)\n- AtLeast1(a)\n- Response(a, b)\n- Precedence(a, b)\n- CoExistence(a, b)\n- NotCoExistence(a, b)\n- NotSuccession(a, b)\n- RespondedExistence(a, b)\n** Only use these templates.

The first and second elements must be a single activity\nIf several valid constraints refer to the same activities, keep only the most restrictive one.

Activity a may appear only as the final step of the project. Reasoning: Because a project has exactly one last step, a cannot be repeated.\n2. Completing activity a requires a single-use safety clearance that can be issued only once per project. Reasoning: Once the unique clearance is consumed, a second a cannot obtain it, so no second occurrence is legal.\n3. The project terminates immediately once activity a has been executed. Reasoning: Ending the schedule right after a leaves no remaining time slots in which another a could happen.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. The maintenance routine begins with a, proceeds through b and c, and then repeats a before concluding with d. Reasoning: a appears both at the start and again before the end—two occurrences.\n2. Every four-hour production cycle executes the sequence a, b, c; the plant runs three such cycles per day. Reasoning: Each cycle contains an a, so the day’s schedule contains a three separate times.\n3. The curriculum covers unit a in week 1 and revisits unit a for advanced exercises in week 4. Reasoning: The same activity a is taught twice in the single course timeline.\n\n\nAtLeast1(a): a occurs at least once, which means the existance of activity a is mandatory. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every case begins with activity a for baseline approval before any other work may proceed. Reasoning: The word “begins” makes a the very first step of every project run, guaranteeing one occurrence.\n2. In each instance, teams must perform activity a to certify the data set’s integrity. Reasoning: Filing the report is part of the process, and a is declared a mandatory predecessor, so at least one a precedes filing.\n3. Any customer-service ticket is automatically routed to a (triage) before it can enter the resolution queue. Reasoning: Since tickets must pass through the queue to be resolved, each ticket necessarily triggers one execution of a.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. When an order arrives with a pre-approved credit flag, the workflow jumps straight to b for planning and never calls a. Reasoning: The conditional branch bypasses a entirely whenever the flag is present, so some executions contain zero a’s.\n2. During off-season maintenance, technicians may optionally perform a or proceed directly to c if no calibration is needed. Reasoning: Because a is labeled ‘optional,’ a valid path exists in which the technicians skip it.\n3. A legacy integration still routes certain tickets directly to c, bypassing a and b altogether. Reasoning: Tickets entering through the legacy path never encounter a, violating the mandatory-presence requirement.\n\n\nResponse(a,b): If a occurs, then b occurs after a.\nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Each new client request triggers a for intake, followed immediately by b for verification before any other tasks may start. Reasoning: a is hard-coded to be immediately succeeded by b; no branch exists between them, so every time a appears, b necessarily follows.\n2. In the onboarding pipeline, once a (collecting identity documents) completes, the workflow engine automatically schedules b (identity validation) as the very next step. Reasoning: The engine inserts b right after a without user discretion, eliminating any path where a occurs and b does not.\n3. For every premium order, a (fraud screening) is executed and, upon success, the system proceeds to b (payment capture) before shipping.

In the express-refund path, an agent can execute b (instant payout) with a supervisor override even when a (fraud check) has not been run. Reasoning: The override permits b to happen in runs where a never took place, so b is not guaranteed to be preceded by a.\n2. During a critical-outage hot-fix, engineers deploy the patch (b) first and run the automated test suite (a) only afterward if time allows. Reasoning: Here b occurs before or even without a, breaking the ‘preceded-by’ requirement.\n3. In urgent onboarding, IT provisions the account (b) while HR finishes creating the employee record (a) the next day. Reasoning: The provisioning action b can occur one or more days before a, contradicting the rule.\n\n\nCoExistence(a,b): a and b occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every new support case triggers a (open-ticket record) and, in the same transaction, auto-creates b (initial customer-reply template). Reasoning: The system executes a composite routine that writes both database rows atomically, so whenever a is logged b is logged too, and neither appears alone.\n2. For each vendor purchase, the ERP posts a (goods-received note) and simultaneously posts b (accounts-payable accrual) in the same commit. Reasoning: Posting logic is wrapped in a single database transaction—if either insert fails the whole transaction rolls back—therefore the system state contains both or neither.\n3. Publishing a news article executes a (content push to CDN) and b (metadata push to search index) as a locked job pair—neither job can be run in isolation. Reasoning: The deploy orchestrator groups them under one job ID; a switch disables standalone execution, guaranteeing paired occurrence.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. For micro-refunds, the agent can execute b (instant payout) while the fraud-check a is skipped. Reasoning: A valid path exists in which b occurs but a does not, so the pair does not always appear together.\n2. A legacy printer service fires b (shipping-label print) on address verification, but if inventory allocation a does not occur, the label still prints. Reasoning: The system can produce b even though a has not completed, so the two are not inseparable.\n3. When a student repeats a passed module, the registrar records a (module enrollment) but suppresses b (fee payment). Reasoning: This branch shows a without b, violating the rule.\n\n  \nNotCoExistence(a,b): a and b never occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. In the loan pipeline, low-risk applications flow through a (automatic approval) while high-risk ones are routed to b (manual committee review). Reasoning: The risk-based router selects exactly one mutually exclusive branch; a case flagged low-risk can never enter the high-risk branch and vice-versa, so no single run contains both a and b.\n2. At checkout a customer must choose either a (credit-card payment) or b (cash-on-delivery); the payment gateway disables the unselected option. Reasoning: The UI enforces a single-selection radio button and downstream code validates one—and only one—payment type, ensuring the two activities never co-appear in the same order.\n3. Regulations permit a sample to be processed via a (wet-lab chemical protocol) for liquid specimens or b (dry-lab bioinformatics) for genomic data, explicitly banning mixed handling. Reasoning: Compliance software validates specimen type before queuing the job and rejects any attempt to schedule the alternate protocol, so a single specimen workflow can contain only one of the two.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Borderline loan applications first undergo a (automated scoring) and then proceed to b (manual credit-committee review) before a decision is issued. Reasoning: A single borderline application clearly contains the sequence a → b, so both activities occur together.\n2. For VIP travel bookings, the system performs a (automatic ticket issuance) while simultaneously dispatching b (manual travel-agent confirmation) as an extra layer of service. Reasoning: Each VIP booking spawns both automated and manual tasks, so a and b co-exist in the same booking workflow.\n3. When a customer changes address on an open order, support runs a (address verification) and then launches b (fraud re-check) within the same service call. Reasoning: The single service request explicitly chains a and b together.\n\nNotSuccession(a,b): b cannot occur after a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The customer-complaint workflow finishes with a (final client sign-off); when that step is saved the ticket auto-closes, making b (internal escalation) impossible afterwards. Reasoning: Activity a terminates the case, so no subsequent task—including b—can be executed.\n2. During checkout, b (fraud screening) is run before payment capture, and once a (payment capture) succeeds the order is locked from further screening. Reasoning: b is always completed earlier in the timeline; after a, the lock prevents any new b event.\n3. In emergency releases, committing a (force merge to main) marks CI job b (code linting) as ‘skipped’ and locks the pipeline. Reasoning: The status change blocks b from running after the merge.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Auditors record a (preliminary sign-off) and then launch b (final compliance audit) to complete the dossier. Reasoning: The workflow explicitly places b after a, proving the forbidden order can occur.\n2. The emergency-release pipeline performs a (force deploy) and only afterwards runs b (post-deploy regression tests). Reasoning: A single deployment run contains a first and b later, so b follows a.\n3. The warehouse seals pallets with a (shipment sealing) and later performs b (random quality-inspection pulls) before loading the truck. Reasoning: Quality inspections b are scheduled chronologically after pallet sealing a.\n\nRespondedExistence(a,b): If a occurs in the trace, then b occurs as well. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Any training session that records a (hands-on lab) must also show b (theory module) on the same attendance sheet. Reasoning: The attendance sheet is invalid without entries for both modules; thus a session containing a always contains b, with order left to the organizer.\n2. Every incident record that contains a (temporary workaround) is required by policy to include b (permanent resolution) in the same incident file. Reasoning: The data model treats the pair as mandatory fields on the same record; whichever is entered first, the other must exist before closure, so any trace with a inevitably contains b, but timing is flexible.\n3. If a sprint backlog includes a (security epic), governance checks confirm that b (pen-test task) is also on the board. Reasoning: Board validation happens at sprint start and end, ensuring both items co-appear even though teams pick their own ordering.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the quick-refund lane, an agent can execute a (issue refund) and close the ticket, while b (root-cause investigation) is marked ‘optional’ and often skipped. Reasoning: A legitimate trace exists where a is present and b never appears, contradicting the implication.\n2. For VIP travelers, the airline auto-issues a (boarding pass) but waives b (secondary identity check) unless a random audit flag is raised. Reasoning: Many VIP traces show a without the corresponding b event.\n3. A late-stage sales opportunity logs a (verbal commitment) immediately, while b (formal contract upload) may be omitted if the deal falls through. Reasoning: When a deal collapses, the trace holds a but never records b.\n\nFor each task, I provide the set of activity labels that exist in the process.\n\n\nThe list of activities used in this process are the following.

    "full_prompt": "Task Overview:\nYou are an assistant that helps translate free-text process descriptions into declarative process constraints.\n\nYour goal is to:\n1) Identify declarative constraints from the text.\n2) Return them in strict JSON format (see below).\n\nJSON Output Format:\nYou must always return a single valid JSON object in this format:\n** Do not return any explanation or markdown. Only return a single valid JSON object exactly like this.**\n{\n  \"constraints\": [\n    {\n      \"template\": \"Response\",\n      \"parameters\": [[\"a\"], [\"b\"]]\n    },\n    {\n      \"template\": \"AtMost1\",\n      \"parameters\": [[\"c\"]]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nSupported Templates:\nConsider only the following declarative constraint definitions where a, b, c, and d are activities and template example-template(x,y) specifies a template named \"example-template\" and x and y can be one of the activities from the set of all activities. The supported declarative constraint templates in our framework are:\n- AtMost1(a)\n- AtLeast1(a)\n- Response(a, b)\n- Precedence(a, b)\n- CoExistence(a, b)\n- NotCoExistence(a, b)\n- NotSuccession(a, b)\n- RespondedExistence(a, b)\n** Only use these templates. Do not invent new ones or use logical operators like “or”. **\n\n\nSome more instructions:\nIt is not possible to generate constraints like Response(a, (b or c)). The first and second elements must be a single activity\nIf several valid constraints refer to the same activities, keep only the most restrictive one. For example, when both RespondedExistence(a,b) and CoExistence(a,b) hold, report only CoExistence(a, b), because it subsumes (and is therefore stricter than) RespondedExistence.\n\n\nInteraction Protocol\nWhen you receive a new input:\n1) You may write reasoning steps (internally) before producing the JSON object — but never include them in the output.\n2) Once confident, generate and return the JSON object containing the constraints.\n3) Do not include explanation or commentary in the output.\n\n\nSome examples to learn the constraints and reasoning better:\nAtMost1(a): a occurs at most once. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Activity a may appear only as the final step of the project. Reasoning: Because a project has exactly one last step, a cannot be repeated.\n2. Completing activity a requires a single-use safety clearance that can be issued only once per project. Reasoning: Once the unique clearance is consumed, a second a cannot obtain it, so no second occurrence is legal.\n3. The project terminates immediately once activity a has been executed. Reasoning: Ending the schedule right after a leaves no remaining time slots in which another a could happen.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. The maintenance routine begins with a, proceeds through b and c, and then repeats a before concluding with d. Reasoning: a appears both at the start and again before the end—two occurrences.\n2. Every four-hour production cycle executes the sequence a, b, c; the plant runs three such cycles per day. Reasoning: Each cycle contains an a, so the day’s schedule contains a three separate times.\n3. The curriculum covers unit a in week 1 and revisits unit a for advanced exercises in week 4. Reasoning: The same activity a is taught twice in the single course timeline.\n\n\nAtLeast1(a): a occurs at least once, which means the existance of activity a is mandatory. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every case begins with activity a for baseline approval before any other work may proceed. Reasoning: The word “begins” makes a the very first step of every project run, guaranteeing one occurrence.\n2. In each instance, teams must perform activity a to certify the data set’s integrity. Reasoning: Filing the report is part of the process, and a is declared a mandatory predecessor, so at least one a precedes filing.\n3. Any customer-service ticket is automatically routed to a (triage) before it can enter the resolution queue. Reasoning: Since tickets must pass through the queue to be resolved, each ticket necessarily triggers one execution of a.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. When an order arrives with a pre-approved credit flag, the workflow jumps straight to b for planning and never calls a. Reasoning: The conditional branch bypasses a entirely whenever the flag is present, so some executions contain zero a’s.\n2. During off-season maintenance, technicians may optionally perform a or proceed directly to c if no calibration is needed. Reasoning: Because a is labeled ‘optional,’ a valid path exists in which the technicians skip it.\n3. A legacy integration still routes certain tickets directly to c, bypassing a and b altogether. Reasoning: Tickets entering through the legacy path never encounter a, violating the mandatory-presence requirement.\n\n\nResponse(a,b): If a occurs, then b occurs after a.\nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Each new client request triggers a for intake, followed immediately by b for verification before any other tasks may start. Reasoning: a is hard-coded to be immediately succeeded by b; no branch exists between them, so every time a appears, b necessarily follows.\n2. In the onboarding pipeline, once a (collecting identity documents) completes, the workflow engine automatically schedules b (identity validation) as the very next step. Reasoning: The engine inserts b right after a without user discretion, eliminating any path where a occurs and b does not.\n3. For every premium order, a (fraud screening) is executed and, upon success, the system proceeds to b (payment capture) before shipping. Reasoning: The success path from a programmatically advances to b; orders cannot ship (the process goal) until b completes, so a ➔ b is enforced.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-checkout flow, the system executes a (payment capture) and ships the order immediately, skipping the fraud-review step b. Reasoning: A occurs, but b never happens, so the implication fails.\n2. During a critical-outage fix, engineers apply a (hot patch) and close the incident log without performing the normal post-patch verification b. Reasoning: The emergency path lets the process end with a but without a subsequent b.\n3. For VIP passengers, security screening b is completed pre-flight, and if an ID issue arises later, staff perform a secondary identity swipe a right at the gate. Reasoning: Here b occurs before a, not after it, breaking the required order.\n\n\nPrecedence(a,b): b occurs only if preceded by a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The manufacturing line enables b (packaging) only after a sensor logs a (final assembly complete). Reasoning: The control logic keeps the packaging station disabled until the assembly-complete flag from a is present, so every time b runs an earlier a must already have finished.\n2. Within the insurance-claims app, b (payout) can be triggered solely when the system finds a prior a (manager approval) entry for that claim. Reasoning: The trigger condition for b is the existence of an approval record; consequently, whenever b happens the claim’s history necessarily contains a preceding a. \n3. The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete. Reasoning: The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1.

Reasoning: The deploy orchestrator groups them under one job ID; a switch disables standalone execution, guaranteeing paired occurrence.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. For micro-refunds, the agent can execute b (instant payout) while the fraud-check a is skipped. Reasoning: A valid path exists in which b occurs but a does not, so the pair does not always appear together.\n2. A legacy printer service fires b (shipping-label print) on address verification, but if inventory allocation a does not occur, the label still prints. Reasoning: The system can produce b even though a has not completed, so the two are not inseparable.\n3. When a student repeats a passed module, the registrar records a (module enrollment) but suppresses b (fee payment). Reasoning: This branch shows a without b, violating the rule.\n\n  \nNotCoExistence(a,b): a and b never occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. In the loan pipeline, low-risk applications flow through a (automatic approval) while high-risk ones are routed to b (manual committee review). Reasoning: The risk-based router selects exactly one mutually exclusive branch; a case flagged low-risk can never enter the high-risk branch and vice-versa, so no single run contains both a and b.\n2. At checkout a customer must choose either a (credit-card payment) or b (cash-on-delivery); the payment gateway disables the unselected option. Reasoning: The UI enforces a single-selection radio button and downstream code validates one—and only one—payment type, ensuring the two activities never co-appear in the same order.\n3. Regulations permit a sample to be processed via a (wet-lab chemical protocol) for liquid specimens or b (dry-lab bioinformatics) for genomic data, explicitly banning mixed handling. Reasoning: Compliance software validates specimen type before queuing the job and rejects any attempt to schedule the alternate protocol, so a single specimen workflow can contain only one of the two.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Borderline loan applications first undergo a (automated scoring) and then proceed to b (manual credit-committee review) before a decision is issued. Reasoning: A single borderline application clearly contains the sequence a → b, so both activities occur together.\n2. For VIP travel bookings, the system performs a (automatic ticket issuance) while simultaneously dispatching b (manual travel-agent confirmation) as an extra layer of service. Reasoning: Each VIP booking spawns both automated and manual tasks, so a and b co-exist in the same booking workflow.\n3. When a customer changes address on an open order, support runs a (address verification) and then launches b (fraud re-check) within the same service call. Reasoning: The single service request explicitly chains a and b together.\n\nNotSuccession(a,b): b cannot occur after a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The customer-complaint workflow finishes with a (final client sign-off); when that step is saved the ticket auto-closes, making b (internal escalation) impossible afterwards. Reasoning: Activity a terminates the case, so no subsequent task—including b—can be executed.\n2. During checkout, b (fraud screening) is run before payment capture, and once a (payment capture) succeeds the order is locked from further screening. Reasoning: b is always completed earlier in the timeline; after a, the lock prevents any new b event.\n3. In emergency releases, committing a (force merge to main) marks CI job b (code linting) as ‘skipped’ and locks the pipeline. Reasoning: The status change blocks b from running after the merge.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Auditors record a (preliminary sign-off) and then launch b (final compliance audit) to complete the dossier. Reasoning: The workflow explicitly places b after a, proving the forbidden order can occur.\n2. The emergency-release pipeline performs a (force deploy) and only afterwards runs b (post-deploy regression tests). Reasoning: A single deployment run contains a first and b later, so b follows a.\n3. The warehouse seals pallets with a (shipment sealing) and later performs b (random quality-inspection pulls) before loading the truck. Reasoning: Quality inspections b are scheduled chronologically after pallet sealing a.\n\nRespondedExistence(a,b): If a occurs in the trace, then b occurs as well. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Any training session that records a (hands-on lab) must also show b (theory module) on the same attendance sheet. Reasoning: The attendance sheet is invalid without entries for both modules; thus a session containing a always contains b, with order left to the organizer.\n2. Every incident record that contains a (temporary workaround) is required by policy to include b (permanent resolution) in the same incident file. Reasoning: The data model treats the pair as mandatory fields on the same record; whichever is entered first, the other must exist before closure, so any trace with a inevitably contains b, but timing is flexible.\n3. If a sprint backlog includes a (security epic), governance checks confirm that b (pen-test task) is also on the board. Reasoning: Board validation happens at sprint start and end, ensuring both items co-appear even though teams pick their own ordering.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the quick-refund lane, an agent can execute a (issue refund) and close the ticket, while b (root-cause investigation) is marked ‘optional’ and often skipped. Reasoning: A legitimate trace exists where a is present and b never appears, contradicting the implication.\n2. For VIP travelers, the airline auto-issues a (boarding pass) but waives b (secondary identity check) unless a random audit flag is raised. Reasoning: Many VIP traces show a without the corresponding b event.\n3. A late-stage sales opportunity logs a (verbal commitment) immediately, while b (formal contract upload) may be omitted if the deal falls through. Reasoning: When a deal collapses, the trace holds a but never records b.\n\nFor each task, I provide the set of activity labels that exist in the process.\n\n\nThe list of activities used in this process are the following. Please only use these activities to generate constraints:\nO_Accepted, A_Cancelled, A_Pending, A_Validating, O_Sent (online only), A_Denied, A_Accepted, O_Sent (mail and online), A_Complete, O_Create Offer, A_Incomplete, A_Submitted\n\nAll pending applications must be preceded by an accepted offer.",

    "full_prompt": "Task Overview:\nYou are an assistant that helps translate free-text process descriptions into declarative process constraints.\n\nYour goal is to:\n1) Identify declarative constraints from the text.\n2) Return them in strict JSON format (see below).\n\nJSON Output Format:\nYou must always return a single valid JSON object in this format:\n** Do not return any explanation or markdown. Only return a single valid JSON object exactly like this.**\n{\n  \"constraints\": [\n    {\n      \"template\": \"Response\",\n      \"parameters\": [[\"a\"], [\"b\"]]\n    },\n    {\n      \"template\": \"AtMost1\",\n      \"parameters\": [[\"c\"]]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nSupported Templates:\nConsider only the following declarative constraint definitions where a, b, c, and d are activities and template example-template(x,y) specifies a template named \"example-template\" and x and y can be one of the activities from the set of all activities. The supported declarative constraint templates in our framework are:\n- AtMost1(a)\n- AtLeast1(a)\n- Response(a, b)\n- Precedence(a, b)\n- CoExistence(a, b)\n- NotCoExistence(a, b)\n- NotSuccession(a, b)\n- RespondedExistence(a, b)\n** Only use these templates. Do not invent new ones or use logical operators like “or”. **\n\n\nSome more instructions:\nIt is not possible to generate constraints like Response(a, (b or c)). The first and second elements must be a single activity\nIf several valid constraints refer to the same activities, keep only the most restrictive one. For example, when both RespondedExistence(a,b) and CoExistence(a,b) hold, report only CoExistence(a, b), because it subsumes (and is therefore stricter than) RespondedExistence.\n\n\nInteraction Protocol\nWhen you receive a new input:\n1) You may write reasoning steps (internally) before producing the JSON object — but never include them in the output.\n2) Once confident, generate and return the JSON object containing the constraints.\n3) Do not include explanation or commentary in the output.\n\n\nSome examples to learn the constraints and reasoning better:\nAtMost1(a): a occurs at most once. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Activity a may appear only as the final step of the project. Reasoning: Because a project has exactly one last step, a cannot be repeated.\n2. Completing activity a requires a single-use safety clearance that can be issued only once per project. Reasoning: Once the unique clearance is consumed, a second a cannot obtain it, so no second occurrence is legal.\n3. The project terminates immediately once activity a has been executed. Reasoning: Ending the schedule right after a leaves no remaining time slots in which another a could happen.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. The maintenance routine begins with a, proceeds through b and c, and then repeats a before concluding with d. Reasoning: a appears both at the start and again before the end—two occurrences.\n2. Every four-hour production cycle executes the sequence a, b, c; the plant runs three such cycles per day. Reasoning: Each cycle contains an a, so the day’s schedule contains a three separate times.\n3. The curriculum covers unit a in week 1 and revisits unit a for advanced exercises in week 4. Reasoning: The same activity a is taught twice in the single course timeline.\n\n\nAtLeast1(a): a occurs at least once, which means the existance of activity a is mandatory. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every case begins with activity a for baseline approval before any other work may proceed. Reasoning: The word “begins” makes a the very first step of every project run, guaranteeing one occurrence.\n2. In each instance, teams must perform activity a to certify the data set’s integrity. Reasoning: Filing the report is part of the process, and a is declared a mandatory predecessor, so at least one a precedes filing.\n3. Any customer-service ticket is automatically routed to a (triage) before it can enter the resolution queue. Reasoning: Since tickets must pass through the queue to be resolved, each ticket necessarily triggers one execution of a.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. When an order arrives with a pre-approved credit flag, the workflow jumps straight to b for planning and never calls a. Reasoning: The conditional branch bypasses a entirely whenever the flag is present, so some executions contain zero a’s.\n2. During off-season maintenance, technicians may optionally perform a or proceed directly to c if no calibration is needed. Reasoning: Because a is labeled ‘optional,’ a valid path exists in which the technicians skip it.\n3. A legacy integration still routes certain tickets directly to c, bypassing a and b altogether. Reasoning: Tickets entering through the legacy path never encounter a, violating the mandatory-presence requirement.\n\n\nResponse(a,b): If a occurs, then b occurs after a.\nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Each new client request triggers a for intake, followed immediately by b for verification before any other tasks may start. Reasoning: a is hard-coded to be immediately succeeded by b; no branch exists between them, so every time a appears, b necessarily follows.\n2. In the onboarding pipeline, once a (collecting identity documents) completes, the workflow engine automatically schedules b (identity validation) as the very next step. Reasoning: The engine inserts b right after a without user discretion, eliminating any path where a occurs and b does not.\n3. For every premium order, a (fraud screening) is executed and, upon success, the system proceeds to b (payment capture) before shipping. Reasoning: The success path from a programmatically advances to b; orders cannot ship (the process goal) until b completes, so a ➔ b is enforced.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-checkout flow, the system executes a (payment capture) and ships the order immediately, skipping the fraud-review step b. Reasoning: A occurs, but b never happens, so the implication fails.\n2. During a critical-outage fix, engineers apply a (hot patch) and close the incident log without performing the normal post-patch verification b. Reasoning: The emergency path lets the process end with a but without a subsequent b.\n3. For VIP passengers, security screening b is completed pre-flight, and if an ID issue arises later, staff perform a secondary identity swipe a right at the gate. Reasoning: Here b occurs before a, not after it, breaking the required order.\n\n\nPrecedence(a,b): b occurs only if preceded by a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The manufacturing line enables b (packaging) only after a sensor logs a (final assembly complete). Reasoning: The control logic keeps the packaging station disabled until the assembly-complete flag from a is present, so every time b runs an earlier a must already have finished.\n2. Within the insurance-claims app, b (payout) can be triggered solely when the system finds a prior a (manager approval) entry for that claim. Reasoning: The trigger condition for b is the existence of an approval record; consequently, whenever b happens the claim’s history necessarily contains a preceding a. \n3. The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete. Reasoning: The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-refund path, an agent can execute b (instant payout) with a supervisor override even when a (fraud check) has not been run. Reasoning: The override permits b to happen in runs where a never took place, so b is not guaranteed to be preceded by a.\n2. During a critical-outage hot-fix, engineers deploy the patch (b) first and run the automated test suite (a) only afterward if time allows. Reasoning: Here b occurs before or even without a, breaking the ‘preceded-by’ requirement.\n3. In urgent onboarding, IT provisions the account (b) while HR finishes creating the employee record (a) the next day. Reasoning: The provisioning action b can occur one or more days before a, contradicting the rule.\n\n\nCoExistence(a,b): a and b occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every new support case triggers a (open-ticket record) and, in the same transaction, auto-creates b (initial customer-reply template). Reasoning: The system executes a composite routine that writes both database rows atomically, so whenever a is logged b is logged too, and neither appears alone.\n2. For each vendor purchase, the ERP posts a (goods-received note) and simultaneously posts b (accounts-payable accrual) in the same commit. Reasoning: Posting logic is wrapped in a single database transaction—if either insert fails the whole transaction rolls back—therefore the system state contains both or neither.\n3. Publishing a news article executes a (content push to CDN) and b (metadata push to search index) as a locked job pair—neither job can be run in isolation.

Regulations permit a sample to be processed via a (wet-lab chemical protocol) for liquid specimens or b (dry-lab bioinformatics) for genomic data, explicitly banning mixed handling. Reasoning: Compliance software validates specimen type before queuing the job and rejects any attempt to schedule the alternate protocol, so a single specimen workflow can contain only one of the two.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Borderline loan applications first undergo a (automated scoring) and then proceed to b (manual credit-committee review) before a decision is issued. Reasoning: A single borderline application clearly contains the sequence a → b, so both activities occur together.\n2. For VIP travel bookings, the system performs a (automatic ticket issuance) while simultaneously dispatching b (manual travel-agent confirmation) as an extra layer of service. Reasoning: Each VIP booking spawns both automated and manual tasks, so a and b co-exist in the same booking workflow.\n3. When a customer changes address on an open order, support runs a (address verification) and then launches b (fraud re-check) within the same service call. Reasoning: The single service request explicitly chains a and b together.\n\nNotSuccession(a,b): b cannot occur after a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The customer-complaint workflow finishes with a (final client sign-off); when that step is saved the ticket auto-closes, making b (internal escalation) impossible afterwards. Reasoning: Activity a terminates the case, so no subsequent task—including b—can be executed.\n2. During checkout, b (fraud screening) is run before payment capture, and once a (payment capture) succeeds the order is locked from further screening. Reasoning: b is always completed earlier in the timeline; after a, the lock prevents any new b event.\n3. In emergency releases, committing a (force merge to main) marks CI job b (code linting) as ‘skipped’ and locks the pipeline. Reasoning: The status change blocks b from running after the merge.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Auditors record a (preliminary sign-off) and then launch b (final compliance audit) to complete the dossier. Reasoning: The workflow explicitly places b after a, proving the forbidden order can occur.\n2. The emergency-release pipeline performs a (force deploy) and only afterwards runs b (post-deploy regression tests). Reasoning: A single deployment run contains a first and b later, so b follows a.\n3. The warehouse seals pallets with a (shipment sealing) and later performs b (random quality-inspection pulls) before loading the truck. Reasoning: Quality inspections b are scheduled chronologically after pallet sealing a.\n\nRespondedExistence(a,b): If a occurs in the trace, then b occurs as well. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Any training session that records a (hands-on lab) must also show b (theory module) on the same attendance sheet. Reasoning: The attendance sheet is invalid without entries for both modules; thus a session containing a always contains b, with order left to the organizer.\n2. Every incident record that contains a (temporary workaround) is required by policy to include b (permanent resolution) in the same incident file. Reasoning: The data model treats the pair as mandatory fields on the same record; whichever is entered first, the other must exist before closure, so any trace with a inevitably contains b, but timing is flexible.\n3. If a sprint backlog includes a (security epic), governance checks confirm that b (pen-test task) is also on the board. Reasoning: Board validation happens at sprint start and end, ensuring both items co-appear even though teams pick their own ordering.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the quick-refund lane, an agent can execute a (issue refund) and close the ticket, while b (root-cause investigation) is marked ‘optional’ and often skipped. Reasoning: A legitimate trace exists where a is present and b never appears, contradicting the implication.\n2. For VIP travelers, the airline auto-issues a (boarding pass) but waives b (secondary identity check) unless a random audit flag is raised. Reasoning: Many VIP traces show a without the corresponding b event.\n3. A late-stage sales opportunity logs a (verbal commitment) immediately, while b (formal contract upload) may be omitted if the deal falls through. Reasoning: When a deal collapses, the trace holds a but never records b.\n\nFor each task, I provide the set of activity labels that exist in the process.\n\n\nThe list of activities used in this process are the following.

Only return a single valid JSON object exactly like this.**\n{\n  \"constraints\": [\n    {\n      \"template\": \"Response\",\n      \"parameters\": [[\"a\"], [\"b\"]]\n    },\n    {\n      \"template\": \"AtMost1\",\n      \"parameters\": [[\"c\"]]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nSupported Templates:\nConsider only the following declarative constraint definitions where a, b, c, and d are activities and template example-template(x,y) specifies a template named \"example-template\" and x and y can be one of the activities from the set of all activities. The supported declarative constraint templates in our framework are:\n- AtMost1(a)\n- AtLeast1(a)\n- Response(a, b)\n- Precedence(a, b)\n- CoExistence(a, b)\n- NotCoExistence(a, b)\n- NotSuccession(a, b)\n- RespondedExistence(a, b)\n** Only use these templates. Do not invent new ones or use logical operators like “or”. **\n\n\nSome more instructions:\nIt is not possible to generate constraints like Response(a, (b or c)). The first and second elements must be a single activity\nIf several valid constraints refer to the same activities, keep only the most restrictive one. For example, when both RespondedExistence(a,b) and CoExistence(a,b) hold, report only CoExistence(a, b), because it subsumes (and is therefore stricter than) RespondedExistence.\n\n\nInteraction Protocol\nWhen you receive a new input:\n1) You may write reasoning steps (internally) before producing the JSON object — but never include them in the output.\n2) Once confident, generate and return the JSON object containing the constraints.\n3) Do not include explanation or commentary in the output.\n\n\nSome examples to learn the constraints and reasoning better:\nAtMost1(a): a occurs at most once. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Activity a may appear only as the final step of the project. Reasoning: Because a project has exactly one last step, a cannot be repeated.\n2. Completing activity a requires a single-use safety clearance that can be issued only once per project. Reasoning: Once the unique clearance is consumed, a second a cannot obtain it, so no second occurrence is legal.\n3. The project terminates immediately once activity a has been executed. Reasoning: Ending the schedule right after a leaves no remaining time slots in which another a could happen.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. The maintenance routine begins with a, proceeds through b and c, and then repeats a before concluding with d. Reasoning: a appears both at the start and again before the end—two occurrences.\n2. Every four-hour production cycle executes the sequence a, b, c; the plant runs three such cycles per day. Reasoning: Each cycle contains an a, so the day’s schedule contains a three separate times.\n3. The curriculum covers unit a in week 1 and revisits unit a for advanced exercises in week 4. Reasoning: The same activity a is taught twice in the single course timeline.\n\n\nAtLeast1(a): a occurs at least once, which means the existance of activity a is mandatory. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every case begins with activity a for baseline approval before any other work may proceed. Reasoning: The word “begins” makes a the very first step of every project run, guaranteeing one occurrence.\n2. In each instance, teams must perform activity a to certify the data set’s integrity. Reasoning: Filing the report is part of the process, and a is declared a mandatory predecessor, so at least one a precedes filing.\n3. Any customer-service ticket is automatically routed to a (triage) before it can enter the resolution queue. Reasoning: Since tickets must pass through the queue to be resolved, each ticket necessarily triggers one execution of a.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. When an order arrives with a pre-approved credit flag, the workflow jumps straight to b for planning and never calls a. Reasoning: The conditional branch bypasses a entirely whenever the flag is present, so some executions contain zero a’s.\n2. During off-season maintenance, technicians may optionally perform a or proceed directly to c if no calibration is needed. Reasoning: Because a is labeled ‘optional,’ a valid path exists in which the technicians skip it.\n3. A legacy integration still routes certain tickets directly to c, bypassing a and b altogether. Reasoning: Tickets entering through the legacy path never encounter a, violating the mandatory-presence requirement.\n\n\nResponse(a,b): If a occurs, then b occurs after a.\nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Each new client request triggers a for intake, followed immediately by b for verification before any other tasks may start. Reasoning: a is hard-coded to be immediately succeeded by b; no branch exists between them, so every time a appears, b necessarily follows.\n2. In the onboarding pipeline, once a (collecting identity documents) completes, the workflow engine automatically schedules b (identity validation) as the very next step. Reasoning: The engine inserts b right after a without user discretion, eliminating any path where a occurs and b does not.\n3. For every premium order, a (fraud screening) is executed and, upon success, the system proceeds to b (payment capture) before shipping. Reasoning: The success path from a programmatically advances to b; orders cannot ship (the process goal) until b completes, so a ➔ b is enforced.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-checkout flow, the system executes a (payment capture) and ships the order immediately, skipping the fraud-review step b. Reasoning: A occurs, but b never happens, so the implication fails.\n2. During a critical-outage fix, engineers apply a (hot patch) and close the incident log without performing the normal post-patch verification b. Reasoning: The emergency path lets the process end with a but without a subsequent b.\n3. For VIP passengers, security screening b is completed pre-flight, and if an ID issue arises later, staff perform a secondary identity swipe a right at the gate. Reasoning: Here b occurs before a, not after it, breaking the required order.\n\n\nPrecedence(a,b): b occurs only if preceded by a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The manufacturing line enables b (packaging) only after a sensor logs a (final assembly complete). Reasoning: The control logic keeps the packaging station disabled until the assembly-complete flag from a is present, so every time b runs an earlier a must already have finished.\n2. Within the insurance-claims app, b (payout) can be triggered solely when the system finds a prior a (manager approval) entry for that claim. Reasoning: The trigger condition for b is the existence of an approval record; consequently, whenever b happens the claim’s history necessarily contains a preceding a. \n3. The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete. Reasoning: The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-refund path, an agent can execute b (instant payout) with a supervisor override even when a (fraud check) has not been run. Reasoning: The override permits b to happen in runs where a never took place, so b is not guaranteed to be preceded by a.\n2. During a critical-outage hot-fix, engineers deploy the patch (b) first and run the automated test suite (a) only afterward if time allows. Reasoning: Here b occurs before or even without a, breaking the ‘preceded-by’ requirement.\n3. In urgent onboarding, IT provisions the account (b) while HR finishes creating the employee record (a) the next day. Reasoning: The provisioning action b can occur one or more days before a, contradicting the rule.\n\n\nCoExistence(a,b): a and b occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every new support case triggers a (open-ticket record) and, in the same transaction, auto-creates b (initial customer-reply template). Reasoning: The system executes a composite routine that writes both database rows atomically, so whenever a is logged b is logged too, and neither appears alone.\n2. For each vendor purchase, the ERP posts a (goods-received note) and simultaneously posts b (accounts-payable accrual) in the same commit. Reasoning: Posting logic is wrapped in a single database transaction—if either insert fails the whole transaction rolls back—therefore the system state contains both or neither.\n3. Publishing a news article executes a (content push to CDN) and b (metadata push to search index) as a locked job pair—neither job can be run in isolation. Reasoning: The deploy orchestrator groups them under one job ID; a switch disables standalone execution, guaranteeing paired occurrence.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. For micro-refunds, the agent can execute b (instant payout) while the fraud-check a is skipped. Reasoning: A valid path exists in which b occurs but a does not, so the pair does not always appear together.\n2. A legacy printer service fires b (shipping-label print) on address verification, but if inventory allocation a does not occur, the label still prints. Reasoning: The system can produce b even though a has not completed, so the two are not inseparable.\n3. When a student repeats a passed module, the registrar records a (module enrollment) but suppresses b (fee payment). Reasoning: This branch shows a without b, violating the rule.\n\n  \nNotCoExistence(a,b): a and b never occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. In the loan pipeline, low-risk applications flow through a (automatic approval) while high-risk ones are routed to b (manual committee review). Reasoning: The risk-based router selects exactly one mutually exclusive branch; a case flagged low-risk can never enter the high-risk branch and vice-versa, so no single run contains both a and b.\n2. At checkout a customer must choose either a (credit-card payment) or b (cash-on-delivery); the payment gateway disables the unselected option.

Every incident record that contains a (temporary workaround) is required by policy to include b (permanent resolution) in the same incident file. Reasoning: The data model treats the pair as mandatory fields on the same record; whichever is entered first, the other must exist before closure, so any trace with a inevitably contains b, but timing is flexible.\n3. If a sprint backlog includes a (security epic), governance checks confirm that b (pen-test task) is also on the board. Reasoning: Board validation happens at sprint start and end, ensuring both items co-appear even though teams pick their own ordering.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the quick-refund lane, an agent can execute a (issue refund) and close the ticket, while b (root-cause investigation) is marked ‘optional’ and often skipped. Reasoning: A legitimate trace exists where a is present and b never appears, contradicting the implication.\n2. For VIP travelers, the airline auto-issues a (boarding pass) but waives b (secondary identity check) unless a random audit flag is raised. Reasoning: Many VIP traces show a without the corresponding b event.\n3.

The supported declarative constraint templates in our framework are:\n- AtMost1(a)\n- AtLeast1(a)\n- Response(a, b)\n- Precedence(a, b)\n- CoExistence(a, b)\n- NotCoExistence(a, b)\n- NotSuccession(a, b)\n- RespondedExistence(a, b)\n** Only use these templates.

The first and second elements must be a single activity\nIf several valid constraints refer to the same activities, keep only the most restrictive one. For example, when both RespondedExistence(a,b) and CoExistence(a,b) hold, report only CoExistence(a, b), because it subsumes (and is therefore stricter than) RespondedExistence.\n\n\nInteraction Protocol\nWhen you receive a new input:\n1) You may write reasoning steps (internally) before producing the JSON object — but never include them in the output.\n2) Once confident, generate and return the JSON object containing the constraints.\n3) Do not include explanation or commentary in the output.\n\n\nSome examples to learn the constraints and reasoning better:\nAtMost1(a): a occurs at most once. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Activity a may appear only as the final step of the project. Reasoning: Because a project has exactly one last step, a cannot be repeated.\n2. Completing activity a requires a single-use safety clearance that can be issued only once per project. Reasoning: Once the unique clearance is consumed, a second a cannot obtain it, so no second occurrence is legal.\n3. The project terminates immediately once activity a has been executed. Reasoning: Ending the schedule right after a leaves no remaining time slots in which another a could happen.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. The maintenance routine begins with a, proceeds through b and c, and then repeats a before concluding with d. Reasoning: a appears both at the start and again before the end—two occurrences.\n2. Every four-hour production cycle executes the sequence a, b, c; the plant runs three such cycles per day. Reasoning: Each cycle contains an a, so the day’s schedule contains a three separate times.\n3. The curriculum covers unit a in week 1 and revisits unit a for advanced exercises in week 4. Reasoning: The same activity a is taught twice in the single course timeline.\n\n\nAtLeast1(a): a occurs at least once, which means the existance of activity a is mandatory. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every case begins with activity a for baseline approval before any other work may proceed. Reasoning: The word “begins” makes a the very first step of every project run, guaranteeing one occurrence.\n2. In each instance, teams must perform activity a to certify the data set’s integrity. Reasoning: Filing the report is part of the process, and a is declared a mandatory predecessor, so at least one a precedes filing.\n3. Any customer-service ticket is automatically routed to a (triage) before it can enter the resolution queue. Reasoning: Since tickets must pass through the queue to be resolved, each ticket necessarily triggers one execution of a.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. When an order arrives with a pre-approved credit flag, the workflow jumps straight to b for planning and never calls a. Reasoning: The conditional branch bypasses a entirely whenever the flag is present, so some executions contain zero a’s.\n2. During off-season maintenance, technicians may optionally perform a or proceed directly to c if no calibration is needed. Reasoning: Because a is labeled ‘optional,’ a valid path exists in which the technicians skip it.\n3. A legacy integration still routes certain tickets directly to c, bypassing a and b altogether. Reasoning: Tickets entering through the legacy path never encounter a, violating the mandatory-presence requirement.\n\n\nResponse(a,b): If a occurs, then b occurs after a.\nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Each new client request triggers a for intake, followed immediately by b for verification before any other tasks may start. Reasoning: a is hard-coded to be immediately succeeded by b; no branch exists between them, so every time a appears, b necessarily follows.\n2. In the onboarding pipeline, once a (collecting identity documents) completes, the workflow engine automatically schedules b (identity validation) as the very next step. Reasoning: The engine inserts b right after a without user discretion, eliminating any path where a occurs and b does not.\n3. For every premium order, a (fraud screening) is executed and, upon success, the system proceeds to b (payment capture) before shipping. Reasoning: The success path from a programmatically advances to b; orders cannot ship (the process goal) until b completes, so a ➔ b is enforced.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-checkout flow, the system executes a (payment capture) and ships the order immediately, skipping the fraud-review step b. Reasoning: A occurs, but b never happens, so the implication fails.\n2. During a critical-outage fix, engineers apply a (hot patch) and close the incident log without performing the normal post-patch verification b. Reasoning: The emergency path lets the process end with a but without a subsequent b.\n3. For VIP passengers, security screening b is completed pre-flight, and if an ID issue arises later, staff perform a secondary identity swipe a right at the gate. Reasoning: Here b occurs before a, not after it, breaking the required order.\n\n\nPrecedence(a,b): b occurs only if preceded by a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The manufacturing line enables b (packaging) only after a sensor logs a (final assembly complete). Reasoning: The control logic keeps the packaging station disabled until the assembly-complete flag from a is present, so every time b runs an earlier a must already have finished.\n2. Within the insurance-claims app, b (payout) can be triggered solely when the system finds a prior a (manager approval) entry for that claim. Reasoning: The trigger condition for b is the existence of an approval record; consequently, whenever b happens the claim’s history necessarily contains a preceding a. \n3. The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete. Reasoning: The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-refund path, an agent can execute b (instant payout) with a supervisor override even when a (fraud check) has not been run. Reasoning: The override permits b to happen in runs where a never took place, so b is not guaranteed to be preceded by a.\n2. During a critical-outage hot-fix, engineers deploy the patch (b) first and run the automated test suite (a) only afterward if time allows. Reasoning: Here b occurs before or even without a, breaking the ‘preceded-by’ requirement.\n3. In urgent onboarding, IT provisions the account (b) while HR finishes creating the employee record (a) the next day. Reasoning: The provisioning action b can occur one or more days before a, contradicting the rule.\n\n\nCoExistence(a,b): a and b occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every new support case triggers a (open-ticket record) and, in the same transaction, auto-creates b (initial customer-reply template). Reasoning: The system executes a composite routine that writes both database rows atomically, so whenever a is logged b is logged too, and neither appears alone.\n2. For each vendor purchase, the ERP posts a (goods-received note) and simultaneously posts b (accounts-payable accrual) in the same commit. Reasoning: Posting logic is wrapped in a single database transaction—if either insert fails the whole transaction rolls back—therefore the system state contains both or neither.\n3. Publishing a news article executes a (content push to CDN) and b (metadata push to search index) as a locked job pair—neither job can be run in isolation. Reasoning: The deploy orchestrator groups them under one job ID; a switch disables standalone execution, guaranteeing paired occurrence.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. For micro-refunds, the agent can execute b (instant payout) while the fraud-check a is skipped. Reasoning: A valid path exists in which b occurs but a does not, so the pair does not always appear together.\n2. A legacy printer service fires b (shipping-label print) on address verification, but if inventory allocation a does not occur, the label still prints. Reasoning: The system can produce b even though a has not completed, so the two are not inseparable.\n3. When a student repeats a passed module, the registrar records a (module enrollment) but suppresses b (fee payment). Reasoning: This branch shows a without b, violating the rule.\n\n  \nNotCoExistence(a,b): a and b never occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. In the loan pipeline, low-risk applications flow through a (automatic approval) while high-risk ones are routed to b (manual committee review). Reasoning: The risk-based router selects exactly one mutually exclusive branch; a case flagged low-risk can never enter the high-risk branch and vice-versa, so no single run contains both a and b.\n2. At checkout a customer must choose either a (credit-card payment) or b (cash-on-delivery); the payment gateway disables the unselected option. Reasoning: The UI enforces a single-selection radio button and downstream code validates one—and only one—payment type, ensuring the two activities never co-appear in the same order.\n3. Regulations permit a sample to be processed via a (wet-lab chemical protocol) for liquid specimens or b (dry-lab bioinformatics) for genomic data, explicitly banning mixed handling. Reasoning: Compliance software validates specimen type before queuing the job and rejects any attempt to schedule the alternate protocol, so a single specimen workflow can contain only one of the two.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Borderline loan applications first undergo a (automated scoring) and then proceed to b (manual credit-committee review) before a decision is issued. Reasoning: A single borderline application clearly contains the sequence a → b, so both activities occur together.\n2. For VIP travel bookings, the system performs a (automatic ticket issuance) while simultaneously dispatching b (manual travel-agent confirmation) as an extra layer of service. Reasoning: Each VIP booking spawns both automated and manual tasks, so a and b co-exist in the same booking workflow.\n3. When a customer changes address on an open order, support runs a (address verification) and then launches b (fraud re-check) within the same service call. Reasoning: The single service request explicitly chains a and b together.\n\nNotSuccession(a,b): b cannot occur after a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The customer-complaint workflow finishes with a (final client sign-off); when that step is saved the ticket auto-closes, making b (internal escalation) impossible afterwards. Reasoning: Activity a terminates the case, so no subsequent task—including b—can be executed.\n2. During checkout, b (fraud screening) is run before payment capture, and once a (payment capture) succeeds the order is locked from further screening. Reasoning: b is always completed earlier in the timeline; after a, the lock prevents any new b event.\n3. In emergency releases, committing a (force merge to main) marks CI job b (code linting) as ‘skipped’ and locks the pipeline. Reasoning: The status change blocks b from running after the merge.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Auditors record a (preliminary sign-off) and then launch b (final compliance audit) to complete the dossier. Reasoning: The workflow explicitly places b after a, proving the forbidden order can occur.\n2.

The first and second elements must be a single activity\nIf several valid constraints refer to the same activities, keep only the most restrictive one.

Activity a may appear only as the final step of the project. Reasoning: Because a project has exactly one last step, a cannot be repeated.\n2. Completing activity a requires a single-use safety clearance that can be issued only once per project. Reasoning: Once the unique clearance is consumed, a second a cannot obtain it, so no second occurrence is legal.\n3. The project terminates immediately once activity a has been executed. Reasoning: Ending the schedule right after a leaves no remaining time slots in which another a could happen.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. The maintenance routine begins with a, proceeds through b and c, and then repeats a before concluding with d. Reasoning: a appears both at the start and again before the end—two occurrences.\n2. Every four-hour production cycle executes the sequence a, b, c; the plant runs three such cycles per day. Reasoning: Each cycle contains an a, so the day’s schedule contains a three separate times.\n3. The curriculum covers unit a in week 1 and revisits unit a for advanced exercises in week 4. Reasoning: The same activity a is taught twice in the single course timeline.\n\n\nAtLeast1(a): a occurs at least once, which means the existance of activity a is mandatory. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every case begins with activity a for baseline approval before any other work may proceed. Reasoning: The word “begins” makes a the very first step of every project run, guaranteeing one occurrence.\n2. In each instance, teams must perform activity a to certify the data set’s integrity. Reasoning: Filing the report is part of the process, and a is declared a mandatory predecessor, so at least one a precedes filing.\n3. Any customer-service ticket is automatically routed to a (triage) before it can enter the resolution queue. Reasoning: Since tickets must pass through the queue to be resolved, each ticket necessarily triggers one execution of a.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. When an order arrives with a pre-approved credit flag, the workflow jumps straight to b for planning and never calls a. Reasoning: The conditional branch bypasses a entirely whenever the flag is present, so some executions contain zero a’s.\n2. During off-season maintenance, technicians may optionally perform a or proceed directly to c if no calibration is needed. Reasoning: Because a is labeled ‘optional,’ a valid path exists in which the technicians skip it.\n3. A legacy integration still routes certain tickets directly to c, bypassing a and b altogether. Reasoning: Tickets entering through the legacy path never encounter a, violating the mandatory-presence requirement.\n\n\nResponse(a,b): If a occurs, then b occurs after a.\nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Each new client request triggers a for intake, followed immediately by b for verification before any other tasks may start. Reasoning: a is hard-coded to be immediately succeeded by b; no branch exists between them, so every time a appears, b necessarily follows.\n2. In the onboarding pipeline, once a (collecting identity documents) completes, the workflow engine automatically schedules b (identity validation) as the very next step. Reasoning: The engine inserts b right after a without user discretion, eliminating any path where a occurs and b does not.\n3. For every premium order, a (fraud screening) is executed and, upon success, the system proceeds to b (payment capture) before shipping. Reasoning: The success path from a programmatically advances to b; orders cannot ship (the process goal) until b completes, so a ➔ b is enforced.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-checkout flow, the system executes a (payment capture) and ships the order immediately, skipping the fraud-review step b. Reasoning: A occurs, but b never happens, so the implication fails.\n2. During a critical-outage fix, engineers apply a (hot patch) and close the incident log without performing the normal post-patch verification b. Reasoning: The emergency path lets the process end with a but without a subsequent b.\n3. For VIP passengers, security screening b is completed pre-flight, and if an ID issue arises later, staff perform a secondary identity swipe a right at the gate. Reasoning: Here b occurs before a, not after it, breaking the required order.\n\n\nPrecedence(a,b): b occurs only if preceded by a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The manufacturing line enables b (packaging) only after a sensor logs a (final assembly complete). Reasoning: The control logic keeps the packaging station disabled until the assembly-complete flag from a is present, so every time b runs an earlier a must already have finished.\n2. Within the insurance-claims app, b (payout) can be triggered solely when the system finds a prior a (manager approval) entry for that claim. Reasoning: The trigger condition for b is the existence of an approval record; consequently, whenever b happens the claim’s history necessarily contains a preceding a. \n3. The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete. Reasoning: The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-refund path, an agent can execute b (instant payout) with a supervisor override even when a (fraud check) has not been run. Reasoning: The override permits b to happen in runs where a never took place, so b is not guaranteed to be preceded by a.\n2. During a critical-outage hot-fix, engineers deploy the patch (b) first and run the automated test suite (a) only afterward if time allows. Reasoning: Here b occurs before or even without a, breaking the ‘preceded-by’ requirement.\n3. In urgent onboarding, IT provisions the account (b) while HR finishes creating the employee record (a) the next day. Reasoning: The provisioning action b can occur one or more days before a, contradicting the rule.\n\n\nCoExistence(a,b): a and b occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every new support case triggers a (open-ticket record) and, in the same transaction, auto-creates b (initial customer-reply template). Reasoning: The system executes a composite routine that writes both database rows atomically, so whenever a is logged b is logged too, and neither appears alone.\n2. For each vendor purchase, the ERP posts a (goods-received note) and simultaneously posts b (accounts-payable accrual) in the same commit. Reasoning: Posting logic is wrapped in a single database transaction—if either insert fails the whole transaction rolls back—therefore the system state contains both or neither.\n3. Publishing a news article executes a (content push to CDN) and b (metadata push to search index) as a locked job pair—neither job can be run in isolation. Reasoning: The deploy orchestrator groups them under one job ID; a switch disables standalone execution, guaranteeing paired occurrence.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. For micro-refunds, the agent can execute b (instant payout) while the fraud-check a is skipped. Reasoning: A valid path exists in which b occurs but a does not, so the pair does not always appear together.\n2. A legacy printer service fires b (shipping-label print) on address verification, but if inventory allocation a does not occur, the label still prints. Reasoning: The system can produce b even though a has not completed, so the two are not inseparable.\n3. When a student repeats a passed module, the registrar records a (module enrollment) but suppresses b (fee payment). Reasoning: This branch shows a without b, violating the rule.\n\n  \nNotCoExistence(a,b): a and b never occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. In the loan pipeline, low-risk applications flow through a (automatic approval) while high-risk ones are routed to b (manual committee review). Reasoning: The risk-based router selects exactly one mutually exclusive branch; a case flagged low-risk can never enter the high-risk branch and vice-versa, so no single run contains both a and b.\n2. At checkout a customer must choose either a (credit-card payment) or b (cash-on-delivery); the payment gateway disables the unselected option. Reasoning: The UI enforces a single-selection radio button and downstream code validates one—and only one—payment type, ensuring the two activities never co-appear in the same order.\n3. Regulations permit a sample to be processed via a (wet-lab chemical protocol) for liquid specimens or b (dry-lab bioinformatics) for genomic data, explicitly banning mixed handling. Reasoning: Compliance software validates specimen type before queuing the job and rejects any attempt to schedule the alternate protocol, so a single specimen workflow can contain only one of the two.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Borderline loan applications first undergo a (automated scoring) and then proceed to b (manual credit-committee review) before a decision is issued. Reasoning: A single borderline application clearly contains the sequence a → b, so both activities occur together.\n2. For VIP travel bookings, the system performs a (automatic ticket issuance) while simultaneously dispatching b (manual travel-agent confirmation) as an extra layer of service. Reasoning: Each VIP booking spawns both automated and manual tasks, so a and b co-exist in the same booking workflow.\n3. When a customer changes address on an open order, support runs a (address verification) and then launches b (fraud re-check) within the same service call. Reasoning: The single service request explicitly chains a and b together.\n\nNotSuccession(a,b): b cannot occur after a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The customer-complaint workflow finishes with a (final client sign-off); when that step is saved the ticket auto-closes, making b (internal escalation) impossible afterwards. Reasoning: Activity a terminates the case, so no subsequent task—including b—can be executed.\n2. During checkout, b (fraud screening) is run before payment capture, and once a (payment capture) succeeds the order is locked from further screening. Reasoning: b is always completed earlier in the timeline; after a, the lock prevents any new b event.\n3. In emergency releases, committing a (force merge to main) marks CI job b (code linting) as ‘skipped’ and locks the pipeline. Reasoning: The status change blocks b from running after the merge.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Auditors record a (preliminary sign-off) and then launch b (final compliance audit) to complete the dossier. Reasoning: The workflow explicitly places b after a, proving the forbidden order can occur.\n2. The emergency-release pipeline performs a (force deploy) and only afterwards runs b (post-deploy regression tests). Reasoning: A single deployment run contains a first and b later, so b follows a.\n3. The warehouse seals pallets with a (shipment sealing) and later performs b (random quality-inspection pulls) before loading the truck. Reasoning: Quality inspections b are scheduled chronologically after pallet sealing a.\n\nRespondedExistence(a,b): If a occurs in the trace, then b occurs as well. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Any training session that records a (hands-on lab) must also show b (theory module) on the same attendance sheet. Reasoning: The attendance sheet is invalid without entries for both modules; thus a session containing a always contains b, with order left to the organizer.\n2. Every incident record that contains a (temporary workaround) is required by policy to include b (permanent resolution) in the same incident file. Reasoning: The data model treats the pair as mandatory fields on the same record; whichever is entered first, the other must exist before closure, so any trace with a inevitably contains b, but timing is flexible.\n3. If a sprint backlog includes a (security epic), governance checks confirm that b (pen-test task) is also on the board. Reasoning: Board validation happens at sprint start and end, ensuring both items co-appear even though teams pick their own ordering.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the quick-refund lane, an agent can execute a (issue refund) and close the ticket, while b (root-cause investigation) is marked ‘optional’ and often skipped. Reasoning: A legitimate trace exists where a is present and b never appears, contradicting the implication.\n2. For VIP travelers, the airline auto-issues a (boarding pass) but waives b (secondary identity check) unless a random audit flag is raised. Reasoning: Many VIP traces show a without the corresponding b event.\n3. A late-stage sales opportunity logs a (verbal commitment) immediately, while b (formal contract upload) may be omitted if the deal falls through. Reasoning: When a deal collapses, the trace holds a but never records b.\n\nFor each task, I provide the set of activity labels that exist in the process.\n\n\nThe list of activities used in this process are the following.

Activity a may appear only as the final step of the project. Reasoning: Because a project has exactly one last step, a cannot be repeated.\n2. Completing activity a requires a single-use safety clearance that can be issued only once per project. Reasoning: Once the unique clearance is consumed, a second a cannot obtain it, so no second occurrence is legal.\n3. The project terminates immediately once activity a has been executed. Reasoning: Ending the schedule right after a leaves no remaining time slots in which another a could happen.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. The maintenance routine begins with a, proceeds through b and c, and then repeats a before concluding with d. Reasoning: a appears both at the start and again before the end—two occurrences.\n2. Every four-hour production cycle executes the sequence a, b, c; the plant runs three such cycles per day. Reasoning: Each cycle contains an a, so the day’s schedule contains a three separate times.\n3. The curriculum covers unit a in week 1 and revisits unit a for advanced exercises in week 4. Reasoning: The same activity a is taught twice in the single course timeline.\n\n\nAtLeast1(a): a occurs at least once, which means the existance of activity a is mandatory. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every case begins with activity a for baseline approval before any other work may proceed. Reasoning: The word “begins” makes a the very first step of every project run, guaranteeing one occurrence.\n2. In each instance, teams must perform activity a to certify the data set’s integrity. Reasoning: Filing the report is part of the process, and a is declared a mandatory predecessor, so at least one a precedes filing.\n3. Any customer-service ticket is automatically routed to a (triage) before it can enter the resolution queue. Reasoning: Since tickets must pass through the queue to be resolved, each ticket necessarily triggers one execution of a.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. When an order arrives with a pre-approved credit flag, the workflow jumps straight to b for planning and never calls a. Reasoning: The conditional branch bypasses a entirely whenever the flag is present, so some executions contain zero a’s.\n2. During off-season maintenance, technicians may optionally perform a or proceed directly to c if no calibration is needed. Reasoning: Because a is labeled ‘optional,’ a valid path exists in which the technicians skip it.\n3. A legacy integration still routes certain tickets directly to c, bypassing a and b altogether. Reasoning: Tickets entering through the legacy path never encounter a, violating the mandatory-presence requirement.\n\n\nResponse(a,b): If a occurs, then b occurs after a.\nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Each new client request triggers a for intake, followed immediately by b for verification before any other tasks may start. Reasoning: a is hard-coded to be immediately succeeded by b; no branch exists between them, so every time a appears, b necessarily follows.\n2. In the onboarding pipeline, once a (collecting identity documents) completes, the workflow engine automatically schedules b (identity validation) as the very next step. Reasoning: The engine inserts b right after a without user discretion, eliminating any path where a occurs and b does not.\n3. For every premium order, a (fraud screening) is executed and, upon success, the system proceeds to b (payment capture) before shipping. Reasoning: The success path from a programmatically advances to b; orders cannot ship (the process goal) until b completes, so a ➔ b is enforced.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-checkout flow, the system executes a (payment capture) and ships the order immediately, skipping the fraud-review step b. Reasoning: A occurs, but b never happens, so the implication fails.\n2. During a critical-outage fix, engineers apply a (hot patch) and close the incident log without performing the normal post-patch verification b. Reasoning: The emergency path lets the process end with a but without a subsequent b.\n3. For VIP passengers, security screening b is completed pre-flight, and if an ID issue arises later, staff perform a secondary identity swipe a right at the gate. Reasoning: Here b occurs before a, not after it, breaking the required order.\n\n\nPrecedence(a,b): b occurs only if preceded by a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The manufacturing line enables b (packaging) only after a sensor logs a (final assembly complete). Reasoning: The control logic keeps the packaging station disabled until the assembly-complete flag from a is present, so every time b runs an earlier a must already have finished.\n2. Within the insurance-claims app, b (payout) can be triggered solely when the system finds a prior a (manager approval) entry for that claim. Reasoning: The trigger condition for b is the existence of an approval record; consequently, whenever b happens the claim’s history necessarily contains a preceding a. \n3. The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete. Reasoning: The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-refund path, an agent can execute b (instant payout) with a supervisor override even when a (fraud check) has not been run. Reasoning: The override permits b to happen in runs where a never took place, so b is not guaranteed to be preceded by a.\n2. During a critical-outage hot-fix, engineers deploy the patch (b) first and run the automated test suite (a) only afterward if time allows. Reasoning: Here b occurs before or even without a, breaking the ‘preceded-by’ requirement.\n3. In urgent onboarding, IT provisions the account (b) while HR finishes creating the employee record (a) the next day. Reasoning: The provisioning action b can occur one or more days before a, contradicting the rule.\n\n\nCoExistence(a,b): a and b occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every new support case triggers a (open-ticket record) and, in the same transaction, auto-creates b (initial customer-reply template). Reasoning: The system executes a composite routine that writes both database rows atomically, so whenever a is logged b is logged too, and neither appears alone.\n2. For each vendor purchase, the ERP posts a (goods-received note) and simultaneously posts b (accounts-payable accrual) in the same commit. Reasoning: Posting logic is wrapped in a single database transaction—if either insert fails the whole transaction rolls back—therefore the system state contains both or neither.\n3. Publishing a news article executes a (content push to CDN) and b (metadata push to search index) as a locked job pair—neither job can be run in isolation. Reasoning: The deploy orchestrator groups them under one job ID; a switch disables standalone execution, guaranteeing paired occurrence.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. For micro-refunds, the agent can execute b (instant payout) while the fraud-check a is skipped. Reasoning: A valid path exists in which b occurs but a does not, so the pair does not always appear together.\n2. A legacy printer service fires b (shipping-label print) on address verification, but if inventory allocation a does not occur, the label still prints. Reasoning: The system can produce b even though a has not completed, so the two are not inseparable.\n3. When a student repeats a passed module, the registrar records a (module enrollment) but suppresses b (fee payment). Reasoning: This branch shows a without b, violating the rule.\n\n  \nNotCoExistence(a,b): a and b never occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. In the loan pipeline, low-risk applications flow through a (automatic approval) while high-risk ones are routed to b (manual committee review). Reasoning: The risk-based router selects exactly one mutually exclusive branch; a case flagged low-risk can never enter the high-risk branch and vice-versa, so no single run contains both a and b.\n2. At checkout a customer must choose either a (credit-card payment) or b (cash-on-delivery); the payment gateway disables the unselected option. Reasoning: The UI enforces a single-selection radio button and downstream code validates one—and only one—payment type, ensuring the two activities never co-appear in the same order.\n3. Regulations permit a sample to be processed via a (wet-lab chemical protocol) for liquid specimens or b (dry-lab bioinformatics) for genomic data, explicitly banning mixed handling. Reasoning: Compliance software validates specimen type before queuing the job and rejects any attempt to schedule the alternate protocol, so a single specimen workflow can contain only one of the two.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Borderline loan applications first undergo a (automated scoring) and then proceed to b (manual credit-committee review) before a decision is issued. Reasoning: A single borderline application clearly contains the sequence a → b, so both activities occur together.\n2. For VIP travel bookings, the system performs a (automatic ticket issuance) while simultaneously dispatching b (manual travel-agent confirmation) as an extra layer of service. Reasoning: Each VIP booking spawns both automated and manual tasks, so a and b co-exist in the same booking workflow.\n3. When a customer changes address on an open order, support runs a (address verification) and then launches b (fraud re-check) within the same service call. Reasoning: The single service request explicitly chains a and b together.\n\nNotSuccession(a,b): b cannot occur after a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The customer-complaint workflow finishes with a (final client sign-off); when that step is saved the ticket auto-closes, making b (internal escalation) impossible afterwards. Reasoning: Activity a terminates the case, so no subsequent task—including b—can be executed.\n2. During checkout, b (fraud screening) is run before payment capture, and once a (payment capture) succeeds the order is locked from further screening. Reasoning: b is always completed earlier in the timeline; after a, the lock prevents any new b event.\n3. In emergency releases, committing a (force merge to main) marks CI job b (code linting) as ‘skipped’ and locks the pipeline. Reasoning: The status change blocks b from running after the merge.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Auditors record a (preliminary sign-off) and then launch b (final compliance audit) to complete the dossier. Reasoning: The workflow explicitly places b after a, proving the forbidden order can occur.\n2. The emergency-release pipeline performs a (force deploy) and only afterwards runs b (post-deploy regression tests). Reasoning: A single deployment run contains a first and b later, so b follows a.\n3. The warehouse seals pallets with a (shipment sealing) and later performs b (random quality-inspection pulls) before loading the truck. Reasoning: Quality inspections b are scheduled chronologically after pallet sealing a.\n\nRespondedExistence(a,b): If a occurs in the trace, then b occurs as well. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Any training session that records a (hands-on lab) must also show b (theory module) on the same attendance sheet. Reasoning: The attendance sheet is invalid without entries for both modules; thus a session containing a always contains b, with order left to the organizer.\n2. Every incident record that contains a (temporary workaround) is required by policy to include b (permanent resolution) in the same incident file. Reasoning: The data model treats the pair as mandatory fields on the same record; whichever is entered first, the other must exist before closure, so any trace with a inevitably contains b, but timing is flexible.\n3. If a sprint backlog includes a (security epic), governance checks confirm that b (pen-test task) is also on the board. Reasoning: Board validation happens at sprint start and end, ensuring both items co-appear even though teams pick their own ordering.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the quick-refund lane, an agent can execute a (issue refund) and close the ticket, while b (root-cause investigation) is marked ‘optional’ and often skipped. Reasoning: A legitimate trace exists where a is present and b never appears, contradicting the implication.\n2. For VIP travelers, the airline auto-issues a (boarding pass) but waives b (secondary identity check) unless a random audit flag is raised. Reasoning: Many VIP traces show a without the corresponding b event.\n3. A late-stage sales opportunity logs a (verbal commitment) immediately, while b (formal contract upload) may be omitted if the deal falls through. Reasoning: When a deal collapses, the trace holds a but never records b.\n\nFor each task, I provide the set of activity labels that exist in the process.\n\n\nThe list of activities used in this process are the following.

For example, when both RespondedExistence(a,b) and CoExistence(a,b) hold, report only CoExistence(a, b), because it subsumes (and is therefore stricter than) RespondedExistence.\n\n\nInteraction Protocol\nWhen you receive a new input:\n1) You may write reasoning steps (internally) before producing the JSON object — but never include them in the output.\n2) Once confident, generate and return the JSON object containing the constraints.\n3) Do not include explanation or commentary in the output.\n\n\nSome examples to learn the constraints and reasoning better:\nAtMost1(a): a occurs at most once. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Activity a may appear only as the final step of the project. Reasoning: Because a project has exactly one last step, a cannot be repeated.\n2. Completing activity a requires a single-use safety clearance that can be issued only once per project. Reasoning: Once the unique clearance is consumed, a second a cannot obtain it, so no second occurrence is legal.\n3. The project terminates immediately once activity a has been executed. Reasoning: Ending the schedule right after a leaves no remaining time slots in which another a could happen.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. The maintenance routine begins with a, proceeds through b and c, and then repeats a before concluding with d. Reasoning: a appears both at the start and again before the end—two occurrences.\n2. Every four-hour production cycle executes the sequence a, b, c; the plant runs three such cycles per day. Reasoning: Each cycle contains an a, so the day’s schedule contains a three separate times.\n3. The curriculum covers unit a in week 1 and revisits unit a for advanced exercises in week 4. Reasoning: The same activity a is taught twice in the single course timeline.\n\n\nAtLeast1(a): a occurs at least once, which means the existance of activity a is mandatory. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every case begins with activity a for baseline approval before any other work may proceed. Reasoning: The word “begins” makes a the very first step of every project run, guaranteeing one occurrence.\n2. In each instance, teams must perform activity a to certify the data set’s integrity. Reasoning: Filing the report is part of the process, and a is declared a mandatory predecessor, so at least one a precedes filing.\n3. Any customer-service ticket is automatically routed to a (triage) before it can enter the resolution queue. Reasoning: Since tickets must pass through the queue to be resolved, each ticket necessarily triggers one execution of a.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. When an order arrives with a pre-approved credit flag, the workflow jumps straight to b for planning and never calls a. Reasoning: The conditional branch bypasses a entirely whenever the flag is present, so some executions contain zero a’s.\n2. During off-season maintenance, technicians may optionally perform a or proceed directly to c if no calibration is needed. Reasoning: Because a is labeled ‘optional,’ a valid path exists in which the technicians skip it.\n3. A legacy integration still routes certain tickets directly to c, bypassing a and b altogether. Reasoning: Tickets entering through the legacy path never encounter a, violating the mandatory-presence requirement.\n\n\nResponse(a,b): If a occurs, then b occurs after a.\nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Each new client request triggers a for intake, followed immediately by b for verification before any other tasks may start. Reasoning: a is hard-coded to be immediately succeeded by b; no branch exists between them, so every time a appears, b necessarily follows.\n2. In the onboarding pipeline, once a (collecting identity documents) completes, the workflow engine automatically schedules b (identity validation) as the very next step. Reasoning: The engine inserts b right after a without user discretion, eliminating any path where a occurs and b does not.\n3. For every premium order, a (fraud screening) is executed and, upon success, the system proceeds to b (payment capture) before shipping. Reasoning: The success path from a programmatically advances to b; orders cannot ship (the process goal) until b completes, so a ➔ b is enforced.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-checkout flow, the system executes a (payment capture) and ships the order immediately, skipping the fraud-review step b. Reasoning: A occurs, but b never happens, so the implication fails.\n2. During a critical-outage fix, engineers apply a (hot patch) and close the incident log without performing the normal post-patch verification b. Reasoning: The emergency path lets the process end with a but without a subsequent b.\n3. For VIP passengers, security screening b is completed pre-flight, and if an ID issue arises later, staff perform a secondary identity swipe a right at the gate. Reasoning: Here b occurs before a, not after it, breaking the required order.\n\n\nPrecedence(a,b): b occurs only if preceded by a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The manufacturing line enables b (packaging) only after a sensor logs a (final assembly complete). Reasoning: The control logic keeps the packaging station disabled until the assembly-complete flag from a is present, so every time b runs an earlier a must already have finished.\n2. Within the insurance-claims app, b (payout) can be triggered solely when the system finds a prior a (manager approval) entry for that claim. Reasoning: The trigger condition for b is the existence of an approval record; consequently, whenever b happens the claim’s history necessarily contains a preceding a. \n3. The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete. Reasoning: The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-refund path, an agent can execute b (instant payout) with a supervisor override even when a (fraud check) has not been run. Reasoning: The override permits b to happen in runs where a never took place, so b is not guaranteed to be preceded by a.\n2. During a critical-outage hot-fix, engineers deploy the patch (b) first and run the automated test suite (a) only afterward if time allows. Reasoning: Here b occurs before or even without a, breaking the ‘preceded-by’ requirement.\n3. In urgent onboarding, IT provisions the account (b) while HR finishes creating the employee record (a) the next day. Reasoning: The provisioning action b can occur one or more days before a, contradicting the rule.\n\n\nCoExistence(a,b): a and b occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every new support case triggers a (open-ticket record) and, in the same transaction, auto-creates b (initial customer-reply template). Reasoning: The system executes a composite routine that writes both database rows atomically, so whenever a is logged b is logged too, and neither appears alone.\n2. For each vendor purchase, the ERP posts a (goods-received note) and simultaneously posts b (accounts-payable accrual) in the same commit. Reasoning: Posting logic is wrapped in a single database transaction—if either insert fails the whole transaction rolls back—therefore the system state contains both or neither.\n3. Publishing a news article executes a (content push to CDN) and b (metadata push to search index) as a locked job pair—neither job can be run in isolation. Reasoning: The deploy orchestrator groups them under one job ID; a switch disables standalone execution, guaranteeing paired occurrence.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. For micro-refunds, the agent can execute b (instant payout) while the fraud-check a is skipped. Reasoning: A valid path exists in which b occurs but a does not, so the pair does not always appear together.\n2. A legacy printer service fires b (shipping-label print) on address verification, but if inventory allocation a does not occur, the label still prints. Reasoning: The system can produce b even though a has not completed, so the two are not inseparable.\n3. When a student repeats a passed module, the registrar records a (module enrollment) but suppresses b (fee payment). Reasoning: This branch shows a without b, violating the rule.\n\n  \nNotCoExistence(a,b): a and b never occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. In the loan pipeline, low-risk applications flow through a (automatic approval) while high-risk ones are routed to b (manual committee review). Reasoning: The risk-based router selects exactly one mutually exclusive branch; a case flagged low-risk can never enter the high-risk branch and vice-versa, so no single run contains both a and b.\n2. At checkout a customer must choose either a (credit-card payment) or b (cash-on-delivery); the payment gateway disables the unselected option. Reasoning: The UI enforces a single-selection radio button and downstream code validates one—and only one—payment type, ensuring the two activities never co-appear in the same order.\n3. Regulations permit a sample to be processed via a (wet-lab chemical protocol) for liquid specimens or b (dry-lab bioinformatics) for genomic data, explicitly banning mixed handling. Reasoning: Compliance software validates specimen type before queuing the job and rejects any attempt to schedule the alternate protocol, so a single specimen workflow can contain only one of the two.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Borderline loan applications first undergo a (automated scoring) and then proceed to b (manual credit-committee review) before a decision is issued. Reasoning: A single borderline application clearly contains the sequence a → b, so both activities occur together.\n2. For VIP travel bookings, the system performs a (automatic ticket issuance) while simultaneously dispatching b (manual travel-agent confirmation) as an extra layer of service. Reasoning: Each VIP booking spawns both automated and manual tasks, so a and b co-exist in the same booking workflow.\n3. When a customer changes address on an open order, support runs a (address verification) and then launches b (fraud re-check) within the same service call. Reasoning: The single service request explicitly chains a and b together.\n\nNotSuccession(a,b): b cannot occur after a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The customer-complaint workflow finishes with a (final client sign-off); when that step is saved the ticket auto-closes, making b (internal escalation) impossible afterwards. Reasoning: Activity a terminates the case, so no subsequent task—including b—can be executed.\n2. During checkout, b (fraud screening) is run before payment capture, and once a (payment capture) succeeds the order is locked from further screening. Reasoning: b is always completed earlier in the timeline; after a, the lock prevents any new b event.\n3. In emergency releases, committing a (force merge to main) marks CI job b (code linting) as ‘skipped’ and locks the pipeline. Reasoning: The status change blocks b from running after the merge.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Auditors record a (preliminary sign-off) and then launch b (final compliance audit) to complete the dossier. Reasoning: The workflow explicitly places b after a, proving the forbidden order can occur.\n2. The emergency-release pipeline performs a (force deploy) and only afterwards runs b (post-deploy regression tests). Reasoning: A single deployment run contains a first and b later, so b follows a.\n3. The warehouse seals pallets with a (shipment sealing) and later performs b (random quality-inspection pulls) before loading the truck. Reasoning: Quality inspections b are scheduled chronologically after pallet sealing a.\n\nRespondedExistence(a,b): If a occurs in the trace, then b occurs as well. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Any training session that records a (hands-on lab) must also show b (theory module) on the same attendance sheet. Reasoning: The attendance sheet is invalid without entries for both modules; thus a session containing a always contains b, with order left to the organizer.\n2. Every incident record that contains a (temporary workaround) is required by policy to include b (permanent resolution) in the same incident file. Reasoning: The data model treats the pair as mandatory fields on the same record; whichever is entered first, the other must exist before closure, so any trace with a inevitably contains b, but timing is flexible.\n3. If a sprint backlog includes a (security epic), governance checks confirm that b (pen-test task) is also on the board. Reasoning: Board validation happens at sprint start and end, ensuring both items co-appear even though teams pick their own ordering.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the quick-refund lane, an agent can execute a (issue refund) and close the ticket, while b (root-cause investigation) is marked ‘optional’ and often skipped. Reasoning: A legitimate trace exists where a is present and b never appears, contradicting the implication.\n2. For VIP travelers, the airline auto-issues a (boarding pass) but waives b (secondary identity check) unless a random audit flag is raised. Reasoning: Many VIP traces show a without the corresponding b event.\n3. A late-stage sales opportunity logs a (verbal commitment) immediately, while b (formal contract upload) may be omitted if the deal falls through. Reasoning: When a deal collapses, the trace holds a but never records b.\n\nFor each task, I provide the set of activity labels that exist in the process.\n\n\nThe list of activities used in this process are the following.

Only return a single valid JSON object exactly like this.**\n{\n  \"constraints\": [\n    {\n      \"template\": \"Response\",\n      \"parameters\": [[\"a\"], [\"b\"]]\n    },\n    {\n      \"template\": \"AtMost1\",\n      \"parameters\": [[\"c\"]]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nSupported Templates:\nConsider only the following declarative constraint definitions where a, b, c, and d are activities and template example-template(x,y) specifies a template named \"example-template\" and x and y can be one of the activities from the set of all activities. The supported declarative constraint templates in our framework are:\n- AtMost1(a)\n- AtLeast1(a)\n- Response(a, b)\n- Precedence(a, b)\n- CoExistence(a, b)\n- NotCoExistence(a, b)\n- NotSuccession(a, b)\n- RespondedExistence(a, b)\n** Only use these templates.

The first and second elements must be a single activity\nIf several valid constraints refer to the same activities, keep only the most restrictive one. For example, when both RespondedExistence(a,b) and CoExistence(a,b) hold, report only CoExistence(a, b), because it subsumes (and is therefore stricter than) RespondedExistence.\n\n\nInteraction Protocol\nWhen you receive a new input:\n1) You may write reasoning steps (internally) before producing the JSON object — but never include them in the output.\n2) Once confident, generate and return the JSON object containing the constraints.\n3) Do not include explanation or commentary in the output.\n\n\nSome examples to learn the constraints and reasoning better:\nAtMost1(a): a occurs at most once. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Activity a may appear only as the final step of the project. Reasoning: Because a project has exactly one last step, a cannot be repeated.\n2. Completing activity a requires a single-use safety clearance that can be issued only once per project. Reasoning: Once the unique clearance is consumed, a second a cannot obtain it, so no second occurrence is legal.\n3. The project terminates immediately once activity a has been executed. Reasoning: Ending the schedule right after a leaves no remaining time slots in which another a could happen.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. The maintenance routine begins with a, proceeds through b and c, and then repeats a before concluding with d. Reasoning: a appears both at the start and again before the end—two occurrences.\n2. Every four-hour production cycle executes the sequence a, b, c; the plant runs three such cycles per day. Reasoning: Each cycle contains an a, so the day’s schedule contains a three separate times.\n3. The curriculum covers unit a in week 1 and revisits unit a for advanced exercises in week 4. Reasoning: The same activity a is taught twice in the single course timeline.\n\n\nAtLeast1(a): a occurs at least once, which means the existance of activity a is mandatory. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every case begins with activity a for baseline approval before any other work may proceed. Reasoning: The word “begins” makes a the very first step of every project run, guaranteeing one occurrence.\n2. In each instance, teams must perform activity a to certify the data set’s integrity. Reasoning: Filing the report is part of the process, and a is declared a mandatory predecessor, so at least one a precedes filing.\n3. Any customer-service ticket is automatically routed to a (triage) before it can enter the resolution queue. Reasoning: Since tickets must pass through the queue to be resolved, each ticket necessarily triggers one execution of a.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. When an order arrives with a pre-approved credit flag, the workflow jumps straight to b for planning and never calls a. Reasoning: The conditional branch bypasses a entirely whenever the flag is present, so some executions contain zero a’s.\n2. During off-season maintenance, technicians may optionally perform a or proceed directly to c if no calibration is needed. Reasoning: Because a is labeled ‘optional,’ a valid path exists in which the technicians skip it.\n3. A legacy integration still routes certain tickets directly to c, bypassing a and b altogether. Reasoning: Tickets entering through the legacy path never encounter a, violating the mandatory-presence requirement.\n\n\nResponse(a,b): If a occurs, then b occurs after a.\nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Each new client request triggers a for intake, followed immediately by b for verification before any other tasks may start. Reasoning: a is hard-coded to be immediately succeeded by b; no branch exists between them, so every time a appears, b necessarily follows.\n2. In the onboarding pipeline, once a (collecting identity documents) completes, the workflow engine automatically schedules b (identity validation) as the very next step. Reasoning: The engine inserts b right after a without user discretion, eliminating any path where a occurs and b does not.\n3. For every premium order, a (fraud screening) is executed and, upon success, the system proceeds to b (payment capture) before shipping. Reasoning: The success path from a programmatically advances to b; orders cannot ship (the process goal) until b completes, so a ➔ b is enforced.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-checkout flow, the system executes a (payment capture) and ships the order immediately, skipping the fraud-review step b. Reasoning: A occurs, but b never happens, so the implication fails.\n2. During a critical-outage fix, engineers apply a (hot patch) and close the incident log without performing the normal post-patch verification b. Reasoning: The emergency path lets the process end with a but without a subsequent b.\n3. For VIP passengers, security screening b is completed pre-flight, and if an ID issue arises later, staff perform a secondary identity swipe a right at the gate. Reasoning: Here b occurs before a, not after it, breaking the required order.\n\n\nPrecedence(a,b): b occurs only if preceded by a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The manufacturing line enables b (packaging) only after a sensor logs a (final assembly complete). Reasoning: The control logic keeps the packaging station disabled until the assembly-complete flag from a is present, so every time b runs an earlier a must already have finished.\n2. Within the insurance-claims app, b (payout) can be triggered solely when the system finds a prior a (manager approval) entry for that claim. Reasoning: The trigger condition for b is the existence of an approval record; consequently, whenever b happens the claim’s history necessarily contains a preceding a. \n3. The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete. Reasoning: The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-refund path, an agent can execute b (instant payout) with a supervisor override even when a (fraud check) has not been run. Reasoning: The override permits b to happen in runs where a never took place, so b is not guaranteed to be preceded by a.\n2. During a critical-outage hot-fix, engineers deploy the patch (b) first and run the automated test suite (a) only afterward if time allows. Reasoning: Here b occurs before or even without a, breaking the ‘preceded-by’ requirement.\n3. In urgent onboarding, IT provisions the account (b) while HR finishes creating the employee record (a) the next day. Reasoning: The provisioning action b can occur one or more days before a, contradicting the rule.\n\n\nCoExistence(a,b): a and b occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every new support case triggers a (open-ticket record) and, in the same transaction, auto-creates b (initial customer-reply template). Reasoning: The system executes a composite routine that writes both database rows atomically, so whenever a is logged b is logged too, and neither appears alone.\n2. For each vendor purchase, the ERP posts a (goods-received note) and simultaneously posts b (accounts-payable accrual) in the same commit. Reasoning: Posting logic is wrapped in a single database transaction—if either insert fails the whole transaction rolls back—therefore the system state contains both or neither.\n3. Publishing a news article executes a (content push to CDN) and b (metadata push to search index) as a locked job pair—neither job can be run in isolation. Reasoning: The deploy orchestrator groups them under one job ID; a switch disables standalone execution, guaranteeing paired occurrence.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. For micro-refunds, the agent can execute b (instant payout) while the fraud-check a is skipped. Reasoning: A valid path exists in which b occurs but a does not, so the pair does not always appear together.\n2. A legacy printer service fires b (shipping-label print) on address verification, but if inventory allocation a does not occur, the label still prints. Reasoning: The system can produce b even though a has not completed, so the two are not inseparable.\n3. When a student repeats a passed module, the registrar records a (module enrollment) but suppresses b (fee payment). Reasoning: This branch shows a without b, violating the rule.\n\n  \nNotCoExistence(a,b): a and b never occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. In the loan pipeline, low-risk applications flow through a (automatic approval) while high-risk ones are routed to b (manual committee review). Reasoning: The risk-based router selects exactly one mutually exclusive branch; a case flagged low-risk can never enter the high-risk branch and vice-versa, so no single run contains both a and b.\n2. At checkout a customer must choose either a (credit-card payment) or b (cash-on-delivery); the payment gateway disables the unselected option. Reasoning: The UI enforces a single-selection radio button and downstream code validates one—and only one—payment type, ensuring the two activities never co-appear in the same order.\n3. Regulations permit a sample to be processed via a (wet-lab chemical protocol) for liquid specimens or b (dry-lab bioinformatics) for genomic data, explicitly banning mixed handling. Reasoning: Compliance software validates specimen type before queuing the job and rejects any attempt to schedule the alternate protocol, so a single specimen workflow can contain only one of the two.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Borderline loan applications first undergo a (automated scoring) and then proceed to b (manual credit-committee review) before a decision is issued. Reasoning: A single borderline application clearly contains the sequence a → b, so both activities occur together.\n2. For VIP travel bookings, the system performs a (automatic ticket issuance) while simultaneously dispatching b (manual travel-agent confirmation) as an extra layer of service. Reasoning: Each VIP booking spawns both automated and manual tasks, so a and b co-exist in the same booking workflow.\n3. When a customer changes address on an open order, support runs a (address verification) and then launches b (fraud re-check) within the same service call. Reasoning: The single service request explicitly chains a and b together.\n\nNotSuccession(a,b): b cannot occur after a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The customer-complaint workflow finishes with a (final client sign-off); when that step is saved the ticket auto-closes, making b (internal escalation) impossible afterwards. Reasoning: Activity a terminates the case, so no subsequent task—including b—can be executed.\n2. During checkout, b (fraud screening) is run before payment capture, and once a (payment capture) succeeds the order is locked from further screening. Reasoning: b is always completed earlier in the timeline; after a, the lock prevents any new b event.\n3. In emergency releases, committing a (force merge to main) marks CI job b (code linting) as ‘skipped’ and locks the pipeline. Reasoning: The status change blocks b from running after the merge.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Auditors record a (preliminary sign-off) and then launch b (final compliance audit) to complete the dossier. Reasoning: The workflow explicitly places b after a, proving the forbidden order can occur.\n2. The emergency-release pipeline performs a (force deploy) and only afterwards runs b (post-deploy regression tests). Reasoning: A single deployment run contains a first and b later, so b follows a.\n3. The warehouse seals pallets with a (shipment sealing) and later performs b (random quality-inspection pulls) before loading the truck. Reasoning: Quality inspections b are scheduled chronologically after pallet sealing a.\n\nRespondedExistence(a,b): If a occurs in the trace, then b occurs as well. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Any training session that records a (hands-on lab) must also show b (theory module) on the same attendance sheet. Reasoning: The attendance sheet is invalid without entries for both modules; thus a session containing a always contains b, with order left to the organizer.\n2. Every incident record that contains a (temporary workaround) is required by policy to include b (permanent resolution) in the same incident file. Reasoning: The data model treats the pair as mandatory fields on the same record; whichever is entered first, the other must exist before closure, so any trace with a inevitably contains b, but timing is flexible.\n3. If a sprint backlog includes a (security epic), governance checks confirm that b (pen-test task) is also on the board. Reasoning: Board validation happens at sprint start and end, ensuring both items co-appear even though teams pick their own ordering.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the quick-refund lane, an agent can execute a (issue refund) and close the ticket, while b (root-cause investigation) is marked ‘optional’ and often skipped. Reasoning: A legitimate trace exists where a is present and b never appears, contradicting the implication.\n2. For VIP travelers, the airline auto-issues a (boarding pass) but waives b (secondary identity check) unless a random audit flag is raised. Reasoning: Many VIP traces show a without the corresponding b event.\n3. A late-stage sales opportunity logs a (verbal commitment) immediately, while b (formal contract upload) may be omitted if the deal falls through. Reasoning: When a deal collapses, the trace holds a but never records b.\n\nFor each task, I provide the set of activity labels that exist in the process.\n\n\nThe list of activities used in this process are the following.

When a customer changes address on an open order, support runs a (address verification) and then launches b (fraud re-check) within the same service call. Reasoning: The single service request explicitly chains a and b together.\n\nNotSuccession(a,b): b cannot occur after a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The customer-complaint workflow finishes with a (final client sign-off); when that step is saved the ticket auto-closes, making b (internal escalation) impossible afterwards. Reasoning: Activity a terminates the case, so no subsequent task—including b—can be executed.\n2. During checkout, b (fraud screening) is run before payment capture, and once a (payment capture) succeeds the order is locked from further screening. Reasoning: b is always completed earlier in the timeline; after a, the lock prevents any new b event.\n3. In emergency releases, committing a (force merge to main) marks CI job b (code linting) as ‘skipped’ and locks the pipeline. Reasoning: The status change blocks b from running after the merge.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Auditors record a (preliminary sign-off) and then launch b (final compliance audit) to complete the dossier. Reasoning: The workflow explicitly places b after a, proving the forbidden order can occur.\n2. The emergency-release pipeline performs a (force deploy) and only afterwards runs b (post-deploy regression tests). Reasoning: A single deployment run contains a first and b later, so b follows a.\n3. The warehouse seals pallets with a (shipment sealing) and later performs b (random quality-inspection pulls) before loading the truck. Reasoning: Quality inspections b are scheduled chronologically after pallet sealing a.\n\nRespondedExistence(a,b): If a occurs in the trace, then b occurs as well. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Any training session that records a (hands-on lab) must also show b (theory module) on the same attendance sheet. Reasoning: The attendance sheet is invalid without entries for both modules; thus a session containing a always contains b, with order left to the organizer.\n2. Every incident record that contains a (temporary workaround) is required by policy to include b (permanent resolution) in the same incident file. Reasoning: The data model treats the pair as mandatory fields on the same record; whichever is entered first, the other must exist before closure, so any trace with a inevitably contains b, but timing is flexible.\n3. If a sprint backlog includes a (security epic), governance checks confirm that b (pen-test task) is also on the board. Reasoning: Board validation happens at sprint start and end, ensuring both items co-appear even though teams pick their own ordering.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the quick-refund lane, an agent can execute a (issue refund) and close the ticket, while b (root-cause investigation) is marked ‘optional’ and often skipped. Reasoning: A legitimate trace exists where a is present and b never appears, contradicting the implication.\n2. For VIP travelers, the airline auto-issues a (boarding pass) but waives b (secondary identity check) unless a random audit flag is raised. Reasoning: Many VIP traces show a without the corresponding b event.\n3. A late-stage sales opportunity logs a (verbal commitment) immediately, while b (formal contract upload) may be omitted if the deal falls through. Reasoning: When a deal collapses, the trace holds a but never records b.\n\nFor each task, I provide the set of activity labels that exist in the process.\n\n\nThe list of activities used in this process are the following. Please only use these activities to generate constraints:\nAccept Claim, Block Claim 3, Receive objection 1, Payment Order, Block Claim 2, Withdraw Claim, Execute Payment, Repayment, Block Claim 1, Correct Claim, Unblock Claim 3, Reject Claim, Receive Claim\n\nIt is not possible to have claims with only repayment or only receiving an objection from the first type.",

    "full_prompt": "Task Overview:\nYou are an assistant that helps translate free-text process descriptions into declarative process constraints.\n\nYour goal is to:\n1) Identify declarative constraints from the text.\n2) Return them in strict JSON format (see below).\n\nJSON Output Format:\nYou must always return a single valid JSON object in this format:\n** Do not return any explanation or markdown. Only return a single valid JSON object exactly like this.**\n{\n  \"constraints\": [\n    {\n      \"template\": \"Response\",\n      \"parameters\": [[\"a\"], [\"b\"]]\n    },\n    {\n      \"template\": \"AtMost1\",\n      \"parameters\": [[\"c\"]]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nSupported Templates:\nConsider only the following declarative constraint definitions where a, b, c, and d are activities and template example-template(x,y) specifies a template named \"example-template\" and x and y can be one of the activities from the set of all activities. The supported declarative constraint templates in our framework are:\n- AtMost1(a)\n- AtLeast1(a)\n- Response(a, b)\n- Precedence(a, b)\n- CoExistence(a, b)\n- NotCoExistence(a, b)\n- NotSuccession(a, b)\n- RespondedExistence(a, b)\n** Only use these templates. Do not invent new ones or use logical operators like “or”. **\n\n\nSome more instructions:\nIt is not possible to generate constraints like Response(a, (b or c)). The first and second elements must be a single activity\nIf several valid constraints refer to the same activities, keep only the most restrictive one. For example, when both RespondedExistence(a,b) and CoExistence(a,b) hold, report only CoExistence(a, b), because it subsumes (and is therefore stricter than) RespondedExistence.\n\n\nInteraction Protocol\nWhen you receive a new input:\n1) You may write reasoning steps (internally) before producing the JSON object — but never include them in the output.\n2) Once confident, generate and return the JSON object containing the constraints.\n3) Do not include explanation or commentary in the output.\n\n\nSome examples to learn the constraints and reasoning better:\nAtMost1(a): a occurs at most once. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Activity a may appear only as the final step of the project. Reasoning: Because a project has exactly one last step, a cannot be repeated.\n2. Completing activity a requires a single-use safety clearance that can be issued only once per project. Reasoning: Once the unique clearance is consumed, a second a cannot obtain it, so no second occurrence is legal.\n3. The project terminates immediately once activity a has been executed. Reasoning: Ending the schedule right after a leaves no remaining time slots in which another a could happen.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. The maintenance routine begins with a, proceeds through b and c, and then repeats a before concluding with d. Reasoning: a appears both at the start and again before the end—two occurrences.\n2. Every four-hour production cycle executes the sequence a, b, c; the plant runs three such cycles per day. Reasoning: Each cycle contains an a, so the day’s schedule contains a three separate times.\n3. The curriculum covers unit a in week 1 and revisits unit a for advanced exercises in week 4. Reasoning: The same activity a is taught twice in the single course timeline.\n\n\nAtLeast1(a): a occurs at least once, which means the existance of activity a is mandatory. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every case begins with activity a for baseline approval before any other work may proceed. Reasoning: The word “begins” makes a the very first step of every project run, guaranteeing one occurrence.\n2. In each instance, teams must perform activity a to certify the data set’s integrity. Reasoning: Filing the report is part of the process, and a is declared a mandatory predecessor, so at least one a precedes filing.\n3. Any customer-service ticket is automatically routed to a (triage) before it can enter the resolution queue. Reasoning: Since tickets must pass through the queue to be resolved, each ticket necessarily triggers one execution of a.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. When an order arrives with a pre-approved credit flag, the workflow jumps straight to b for planning and never calls a. Reasoning: The conditional branch bypasses a entirely whenever the flag is present, so some executions contain zero a’s.\n2. During off-season maintenance, technicians may optionally perform a or proceed directly to c if no calibration is needed. Reasoning: Because a is labeled ‘optional,’ a valid path exists in which the technicians skip it.\n3. A legacy integration still routes certain tickets directly to c, bypassing a and b altogether. Reasoning: Tickets entering through the legacy path never encounter a, violating the mandatory-presence requirement.\n\n\nResponse(a,b): If a occurs, then b occurs after a.\nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Each new client request triggers a for intake, followed immediately by b for verification before any other tasks may start. Reasoning: a is hard-coded to be immediately succeeded by b; no branch exists between them, so every time a appears, b necessarily follows.\n2. In the onboarding pipeline, once a (collecting identity documents) completes, the workflow engine automatically schedules b (identity validation) as the very next step. Reasoning: The engine inserts b right after a without user discretion, eliminating any path where a occurs and b does not.\n3. For every premium order, a (fraud screening) is executed and, upon success, the system proceeds to b (payment capture) before shipping. Reasoning: The success path from a programmatically advances to b; orders cannot ship (the process goal) until b completes, so a ➔ b is enforced.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-checkout flow, the system executes a (payment capture) and ships the order immediately, skipping the fraud-review step b. Reasoning: A occurs, but b never happens, so the implication fails.\n2. During a critical-outage fix, engineers apply a (hot patch) and close the incident log without performing the normal post-patch verification b. Reasoning: The emergency path lets the process end with a but without a subsequent b.\n3. For VIP passengers, security screening b is completed pre-flight, and if an ID issue arises later, staff perform a secondary identity swipe a right at the gate. Reasoning: Here b occurs before a, not after it, breaking the required order.\n\n\nPrecedence(a,b): b occurs only if preceded by a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The manufacturing line enables b (packaging) only after a sensor logs a (final assembly complete). Reasoning: The control logic keeps the packaging station disabled until the assembly-complete flag from a is present, so every time b runs an earlier a must already have finished.\n2. Within the insurance-claims app, b (payout) can be triggered solely when the system finds a prior a (manager approval) entry for that claim. Reasoning: The trigger condition for b is the existence of an approval record; consequently, whenever b happens the claim’s history necessarily contains a preceding a. \n3. The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete. Reasoning: The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-refund path, an agent can execute b (instant payout) with a supervisor override even when a (fraud check) has not been run. Reasoning: The override permits b to happen in runs where a never took place, so b is not guaranteed to be preceded by a.\n2. During a critical-outage hot-fix, engineers deploy the patch (b) first and run the automated test suite (a) only afterward if time allows. Reasoning: Here b occurs before or even without a, breaking the ‘preceded-by’ requirement.\n3. In urgent onboarding, IT provisions the account (b) while HR finishes creating the employee record (a) the next day. Reasoning: The provisioning action b can occur one or more days before a, contradicting the rule.\n\n\nCoExistence(a,b): a and b occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every new support case triggers a (open-ticket record) and, in the same transaction, auto-creates b (initial customer-reply template). Reasoning: The system executes a composite routine that writes both database rows atomically, so whenever a is logged b is logged too, and neither appears alone.\n2. For each vendor purchase, the ERP posts a (goods-received note) and simultaneously posts b (accounts-payable accrual) in the same commit. Reasoning: Posting logic is wrapped in a single database transaction—if either insert fails the whole transaction rolls back—therefore the system state contains both or neither.\n3. Publishing a news article executes a (content push to CDN) and b (metadata push to search index) as a locked job pair—neither job can be run in isolation. Reasoning: The deploy orchestrator groups them under one job ID; a switch disables standalone execution, guaranteeing paired occurrence.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. For micro-refunds, the agent can execute b (instant payout) while the fraud-check a is skipped. Reasoning: A valid path exists in which b occurs but a does not, so the pair does not always appear together.\n2. A legacy printer service fires b (shipping-label print) on address verification, but if inventory allocation a does not occur, the label still prints. Reasoning: The system can produce b even though a has not completed, so the two are not inseparable.\n3. When a student repeats a passed module, the registrar records a (module enrollment) but suppresses b (fee payment). Reasoning: This branch shows a without b, violating the rule.\n\n  \nNotCoExistence(a,b): a and b never occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. In the loan pipeline, low-risk applications flow through a (automatic approval) while high-risk ones are routed to b (manual committee review). Reasoning: The risk-based router selects exactly one mutually exclusive branch; a case flagged low-risk can never enter the high-risk branch and vice-versa, so no single run contains both a and b.\n2. At checkout a customer must choose either a (credit-card payment) or b (cash-on-delivery); the payment gateway disables the unselected option. Reasoning: The UI enforces a single-selection radio button and downstream code validates one—and only one—payment type, ensuring the two activities never co-appear in the same order.\n3. Regulations permit a sample to be processed via a (wet-lab chemical protocol) for liquid specimens or b (dry-lab bioinformatics) for genomic data, explicitly banning mixed handling. Reasoning: Compliance software validates specimen type before queuing the job and rejects any attempt to schedule the alternate protocol, so a single specimen workflow can contain only one of the two.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Borderline loan applications first undergo a (automated scoring) and then proceed to b (manual credit-committee review) before a decision is issued. Reasoning: A single borderline application clearly contains the sequence a → b, so both activities occur together.\n2. For VIP travel bookings, the system performs a (automatic ticket issuance) while simultaneously dispatching b (manual travel-agent confirmation) as an extra layer of service.

Reasoning: The workflow explicitly places b after a, proving the forbidden order can occur.\n2. The emergency-release pipeline performs a (force deploy) and only afterwards runs b (post-deploy regression tests). Reasoning: A single deployment run contains a first and b later, so b follows a.\n3. The warehouse seals pallets with a (shipment sealing) and later performs b (random quality-inspection pulls) before loading the truck. Reasoning: Quality inspections b are scheduled chronologically after pallet sealing a.\n\nRespondedExistence(a,b): If a occurs in the trace, then b occurs as well. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Any training session that records a (hands-on lab) must also show b (theory module) on the same attendance sheet. Reasoning: The attendance sheet is invalid without entries for both modules; thus a session containing a always contains b, with order left to the organizer.\n2. Every incident record that contains a (temporary workaround) is required by policy to include b (permanent resolution) in the same incident file. Reasoning: The data model treats the pair as mandatory fields on the same record; whichever is entered first, the other must exist before closure, so any trace with a inevitably contains b, but timing is flexible.\n3. If a sprint backlog includes a (security epic), governance checks confirm that b (pen-test task) is also on the board. Reasoning: Board validation happens at sprint start and end, ensuring both items co-appear even though teams pick their own ordering.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the quick-refund lane, an agent can execute a (issue refund) and close the ticket, while b (root-cause investigation) is marked ‘optional’ and often skipped. Reasoning: A legitimate trace exists where a is present and b never appears, contradicting the implication.\n2. For VIP travelers, the airline auto-issues a (boarding pass) but waives b (secondary identity check) unless a random audit flag is raised. Reasoning: Many VIP traces show a without the corresponding b event.\n3. A late-stage sales opportunity logs a (verbal commitment) immediately, while b (formal contract upload) may be omitted if the deal falls through. Reasoning: When a deal collapses, the trace holds a but never records b.\n\nFor each task, I provide the set of activity labels that exist in the process.\n\n\nThe list of activities used in this process are the following.

Only return a single valid JSON object exactly like this.**\n{\n  \"constraints\": [\n    {\n      \"template\": \"Response\",\n      \"parameters\": [[\"a\"], [\"b\"]]\n    },\n    {\n      \"template\": \"AtMost1\",\n      \"parameters\": [[\"c\"]]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nSupported Templates:\nConsider only the following declarative constraint definitions where a, b, c, and d are activities and template example-template(x,y) specifies a template named \"example-template\" and x and y can be one of the activities from the set of all activities. The supported declarative constraint templates in our framework are:\n- AtMost1(a)\n- AtLeast1(a)\n- Response(a, b)\n- Precedence(a, b)\n- CoExistence(a, b)\n- NotCoExistence(a, b)\n- NotSuccession(a, b)\n- RespondedExistence(a, b)\n** Only use these templates. Do not invent new ones or use logical operators like “or”. **\n\n\nSome more instructions:\nIt is not possible to generate constraints like Response(a, (b or c)). The first and second elements must be a single activity\nIf several valid constraints refer to the same activities, keep only the most restrictive one. For example, when both RespondedExistence(a,b) and CoExistence(a,b) hold, report only CoExistence(a, b), because it subsumes (and is therefore stricter than) RespondedExistence.\n\n\nInteraction Protocol\nWhen you receive a new input:\n1) You may write reasoning steps (internally) before producing the JSON object — but never include them in the output.\n2) Once confident, generate and return the JSON object containing the constraints.\n3) Do not include explanation or commentary in the output.\n\n\nSome examples to learn the constraints and reasoning better:\nAtMost1(a): a occurs at most once. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Activity a may appear only as the final step of the project. Reasoning: Because a project has exactly one last step, a cannot be repeated.\n2. Completing activity a requires a single-use safety clearance that can be issued only once per project. Reasoning: Once the unique clearance is consumed, a second a cannot obtain it, so no second occurrence is legal.\n3. The project terminates immediately once activity a has been executed. Reasoning: Ending the schedule right after a leaves no remaining time slots in which another a could happen.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. The maintenance routine begins with a, proceeds through b and c, and then repeats a before concluding with d. Reasoning: a appears both at the start and again before the end—two occurrences.\n2. Every four-hour production cycle executes the sequence a, b, c; the plant runs three such cycles per day. Reasoning: Each cycle contains an a, so the day’s schedule contains a three separate times.\n3. The curriculum covers unit a in week 1 and revisits unit a for advanced exercises in week 4. Reasoning: The same activity a is taught twice in the single course timeline.\n\n\nAtLeast1(a): a occurs at least once, which means the existance of activity a is mandatory. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every case begins with activity a for baseline approval before any other work may proceed. Reasoning: The word “begins” makes a the very first step of every project run, guaranteeing one occurrence.\n2. In each instance, teams must perform activity a to certify the data set’s integrity. Reasoning: Filing the report is part of the process, and a is declared a mandatory predecessor, so at least one a precedes filing.\n3. Any customer-service ticket is automatically routed to a (triage) before it can enter the resolution queue. Reasoning: Since tickets must pass through the queue to be resolved, each ticket necessarily triggers one execution of a.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. When an order arrives with a pre-approved credit flag, the workflow jumps straight to b for planning and never calls a. Reasoning: The conditional branch bypasses a entirely whenever the flag is present, so some executions contain zero a’s.\n2. During off-season maintenance, technicians may optionally perform a or proceed directly to c if no calibration is needed. Reasoning: Because a is labeled ‘optional,’ a valid path exists in which the technicians skip it.\n3. A legacy integration still routes certain tickets directly to c, bypassing a and b altogether. Reasoning: Tickets entering through the legacy path never encounter a, violating the mandatory-presence requirement.\n\n\nResponse(a,b): If a occurs, then b occurs after a.\nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Each new client request triggers a for intake, followed immediately by b for verification before any other tasks may start. Reasoning: a is hard-coded to be immediately succeeded by b; no branch exists between them, so every time a appears, b necessarily follows.\n2. In the onboarding pipeline, once a (collecting identity documents) completes, the workflow engine automatically schedules b (identity validation) as the very next step. Reasoning: The engine inserts b right after a without user discretion, eliminating any path where a occurs and b does not.\n3. For every premium order, a (fraud screening) is executed and, upon success, the system proceeds to b (payment capture) before shipping. Reasoning: The success path from a programmatically advances to b; orders cannot ship (the process goal) until b completes, so a ➔ b is enforced.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-checkout flow, the system executes a (payment capture) and ships the order immediately, skipping the fraud-review step b. Reasoning: A occurs, but b never happens, so the implication fails.\n2. During a critical-outage fix, engineers apply a (hot patch) and close the incident log without performing the normal post-patch verification b. Reasoning: The emergency path lets the process end with a but without a subsequent b.\n3. For VIP passengers, security screening b is completed pre-flight, and if an ID issue arises later, staff perform a secondary identity swipe a right at the gate. Reasoning: Here b occurs before a, not after it, breaking the required order.\n\n\nPrecedence(a,b): b occurs only if preceded by a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The manufacturing line enables b (packaging) only after a sensor logs a (final assembly complete). Reasoning: The control logic keeps the packaging station disabled until the assembly-complete flag from a is present, so every time b runs an earlier a must already have finished.\n2. Within the insurance-claims app, b (payout) can be triggered solely when the system finds a prior a (manager approval) entry for that claim. Reasoning: The trigger condition for b is the existence of an approval record; consequently, whenever b happens the claim’s history necessarily contains a preceding a. \n3. The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete. Reasoning: The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-refund path, an agent can execute b (instant payout) with a supervisor override even when a (fraud check) has not been run. Reasoning: The override permits b to happen in runs where a never took place, so b is not guaranteed to be preceded by a.\n2. During a critical-outage hot-fix, engineers deploy the patch (b) first and run the automated test suite (a) only afterward if time allows. Reasoning: Here b occurs before or even without a, breaking the ‘preceded-by’ requirement.\n3. In urgent onboarding, IT provisions the account (b) while HR finishes creating the employee record (a) the next day. Reasoning: The provisioning action b can occur one or more days before a, contradicting the rule.\n\n\nCoExistence(a,b): a and b occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every new support case triggers a (open-ticket record) and, in the same transaction, auto-creates b (initial customer-reply template). Reasoning: The system executes a composite routine that writes both database rows atomically, so whenever a is logged b is logged too, and neither appears alone.\n2. For each vendor purchase, the ERP posts a (goods-received note) and simultaneously posts b (accounts-payable accrual) in the same commit. Reasoning: Posting logic is wrapped in a single database transaction—if either insert fails the whole transaction rolls back—therefore the system state contains both or neither.\n3. Publishing a news article executes a (content push to CDN) and b (metadata push to search index) as a locked job pair—neither job can be run in isolation. Reasoning: The deploy orchestrator groups them under one job ID; a switch disables standalone execution, guaranteeing paired occurrence.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. For micro-refunds, the agent can execute b (instant payout) while the fraud-check a is skipped. Reasoning: A valid path exists in which b occurs but a does not, so the pair does not always appear together.\n2. A legacy printer service fires b (shipping-label print) on address verification, but if inventory allocation a does not occur, the label still prints. Reasoning: The system can produce b even though a has not completed, so the two are not inseparable.\n3. When a student repeats a passed module, the registrar records a (module enrollment) but suppresses b (fee payment). Reasoning: This branch shows a without b, violating the rule.\n\n  \nNotCoExistence(a,b): a and b never occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. In the loan pipeline, low-risk applications flow through a (automatic approval) while high-risk ones are routed to b (manual committee review). Reasoning: The risk-based router selects exactly one mutually exclusive branch; a case flagged low-risk can never enter the high-risk branch and vice-versa, so no single run contains both a and b.\n2. At checkout a customer must choose either a (credit-card payment) or b (cash-on-delivery); the payment gateway disables the unselected option. Reasoning: The UI enforces a single-selection radio button and downstream code validates one—and only one—payment type, ensuring the two activities never co-appear in the same order.\n3. Regulations permit a sample to be processed via a (wet-lab chemical protocol) for liquid specimens or b (dry-lab bioinformatics) for genomic data, explicitly banning mixed handling. Reasoning: Compliance software validates specimen type before queuing the job and rejects any attempt to schedule the alternate protocol, so a single specimen workflow can contain only one of the two.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Borderline loan applications first undergo a (automated scoring) and then proceed to b (manual credit-committee review) before a decision is issued. Reasoning: A single borderline application clearly contains the sequence a → b, so both activities occur together.\n2. For VIP travel bookings, the system performs a (automatic ticket issuance) while simultaneously dispatching b (manual travel-agent confirmation) as an extra layer of service. Reasoning: Each VIP booking spawns both automated and manual tasks, so a and b co-exist in the same booking workflow.\n3. When a customer changes address on an open order, support runs a (address verification) and then launches b (fraud re-check) within the same service call. Reasoning: The single service request explicitly chains a and b together.\n\nNotSuccession(a,b): b cannot occur after a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The customer-complaint workflow finishes with a (final client sign-off); when that step is saved the ticket auto-closes, making b (internal escalation) impossible afterwards. Reasoning: Activity a terminates the case, so no subsequent task—including b—can be executed.\n2. During checkout, b (fraud screening) is run before payment capture, and once a (payment capture) succeeds the order is locked from further screening. Reasoning: b is always completed earlier in the timeline; after a, the lock prevents any new b event.\n3. In emergency releases, committing a (force merge to main) marks CI job b (code linting) as ‘skipped’ and locks the pipeline. Reasoning: The status change blocks b from running after the merge.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Auditors record a (preliminary sign-off) and then launch b (final compliance audit) to complete the dossier.

    "full_prompt": "Task Overview:\nYou are an assistant that helps translate free-text process descriptions into declarative process constraints.\n\nYour goal is to:\n1) Identify declarative constraints from the text.\n2) Return them in strict JSON format (see below).\n\nJSON Output Format:\nYou must always return a single valid JSON object in this format:\n** Do not return any explanation or markdown. Only return a single valid JSON object exactly like this.**\n{\n  \"constraints\": [\n    {\n      \"template\": \"Response\",\n      \"parameters\": [[\"a\"], [\"b\"]]\n    },\n    {\n      \"template\": \"AtMost1\",\n      \"parameters\": [[\"c\"]]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nSupported Templates:\nConsider only the following declarative constraint definitions where a, b, c, and d are activities and template example-template(x,y) specifies a template named \"example-template\" and x and y can be one of the activities from the set of all activities. The supported declarative constraint templates in our framework are:\n- AtMost1(a)\n- AtLeast1(a)\n- Response(a, b)\n- Precedence(a, b)\n- CoExistence(a, b)\n- NotCoExistence(a, b)\n- NotSuccession(a, b)\n- RespondedExistence(a, b)\n** Only use these templates. Do not invent new ones or use logical operators like “or”. **\n\n\nSome more instructions:\nIt is not possible to generate constraints like Response(a, (b or c)). The first and second elements must be a single activity\nIf several valid constraints refer to the same activities, keep only the most restrictive one. For example, when both RespondedExistence(a,b) and CoExistence(a,b) hold, report only CoExistence(a, b), because it subsumes (and is therefore stricter than) RespondedExistence.\n\n\nInteraction Protocol\nWhen you receive a new input:\n1) You may write reasoning steps (internally) before producing the JSON object — but never include them in the output.\n2) Once confident, generate and return the JSON object containing the constraints.\n3) Do not include explanation or commentary in the output.\n\n\nSome examples to learn the constraints and reasoning better:\nAtMost1(a): a occurs at most once. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Activity a may appear only as the final step of the project. Reasoning: Because a project has exactly one last step, a cannot be repeated.\n2. Completing activity a requires a single-use safety clearance that can be issued only once per project. Reasoning: Once the unique clearance is consumed, a second a cannot obtain it, so no second occurrence is legal.\n3. The project terminates immediately once activity a has been executed. Reasoning: Ending the schedule right after a leaves no remaining time slots in which another a could happen.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. The maintenance routine begins with a, proceeds through b and c, and then repeats a before concluding with d. Reasoning: a appears both at the start and again before the end—two occurrences.\n2. Every four-hour production cycle executes the sequence a, b, c; the plant runs three such cycles per day. Reasoning: Each cycle contains an a, so the day’s schedule contains a three separate times.\n3. The curriculum covers unit a in week 1 and revisits unit a for advanced exercises in week 4. Reasoning: The same activity a is taught twice in the single course timeline.\n\n\nAtLeast1(a): a occurs at least once, which means the existance of activity a is mandatory. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every case begins with activity a for baseline approval before any other work may proceed. Reasoning: The word “begins” makes a the very first step of every project run, guaranteeing one occurrence.\n2. In each instance, teams must perform activity a to certify the data set’s integrity. Reasoning: Filing the report is part of the process, and a is declared a mandatory predecessor, so at least one a precedes filing.\n3. Any customer-service ticket is automatically routed to a (triage) before it can enter the resolution queue. Reasoning: Since tickets must pass through the queue to be resolved, each ticket necessarily triggers one execution of a.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. When an order arrives with a pre-approved credit flag, the workflow jumps straight to b for planning and never calls a. Reasoning: The conditional branch bypasses a entirely whenever the flag is present, so some executions contain zero a’s.\n2. During off-season maintenance, technicians may optionally perform a or proceed directly to c if no calibration is needed. Reasoning: Because a is labeled ‘optional,’ a valid path exists in which the technicians skip it.\n3. A legacy integration still routes certain tickets directly to c, bypassing a and b altogether. Reasoning: Tickets entering through the legacy path never encounter a, violating the mandatory-presence requirement.\n\n\nResponse(a,b): If a occurs, then b occurs after a.\nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Each new client request triggers a for intake, followed immediately by b for verification before any other tasks may start. Reasoning: a is hard-coded to be immediately succeeded by b; no branch exists between them, so every time a appears, b necessarily follows.\n2. In the onboarding pipeline, once a (collecting identity documents) completes, the workflow engine automatically schedules b (identity validation) as the very next step. Reasoning: The engine inserts b right after a without user discretion, eliminating any path where a occurs and b does not.\n3. For every premium order, a (fraud screening) is executed and, upon success, the system proceeds to b (payment capture) before shipping. Reasoning: The success path from a programmatically advances to b; orders cannot ship (the process goal) until b completes, so a ➔ b is enforced.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-checkout flow, the system executes a (payment capture) and ships the order immediately, skipping the fraud-review step b. Reasoning: A occurs, but b never happens, so the implication fails.\n2. During a critical-outage fix, engineers apply a (hot patch) and close the incident log without performing the normal post-patch verification b. Reasoning: The emergency path lets the process end with a but without a subsequent b.\n3. For VIP passengers, security screening b is completed pre-flight, and if an ID issue arises later, staff perform a secondary identity swipe a right at the gate. Reasoning: Here b occurs before a, not after it, breaking the required order.\n\n\nPrecedence(a,b): b occurs only if preceded by a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The manufacturing line enables b (packaging) only after a sensor logs a (final assembly complete). Reasoning: The control logic keeps the packaging station disabled until the assembly-complete flag from a is present, so every time b runs an earlier a must already have finished.\n2. Within the insurance-claims app, b (payout) can be triggered solely when the system finds a prior a (manager approval) entry for that claim. Reasoning: The trigger condition for b is the existence of an approval record; consequently, whenever b happens the claim’s history necessarily contains a preceding a. \n3. The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete. Reasoning: The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-refund path, an agent can execute b (instant payout) with a supervisor override even when a (fraud check) has not been run. Reasoning: The override permits b to happen in runs where a never took place, so b is not guaranteed to be preceded by a.\n2. During a critical-outage hot-fix, engineers deploy the patch (b) first and run the automated test suite (a) only afterward if time allows. Reasoning: Here b occurs before or even without a, breaking the ‘preceded-by’ requirement.\n3. In urgent onboarding, IT provisions the account (b) while HR finishes creating the employee record (a) the next day. Reasoning: The provisioning action b can occur one or more days before a, contradicting the rule.\n\n\nCoExistence(a,b): a and b occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every new support case triggers a (open-ticket record) and, in the same transaction, auto-creates b (initial customer-reply template). Reasoning: The system executes a composite routine that writes both database rows atomically, so whenever a is logged b is logged too, and neither appears alone.\n2. For each vendor purchase, the ERP posts a (goods-received note) and simultaneously posts b (accounts-payable accrual) in the same commit. Reasoning: Posting logic is wrapped in a single database transaction—if either insert fails the whole transaction rolls back—therefore the system state contains both or neither.\n3. Publishing a news article executes a (content push to CDN) and b (metadata push to search index) as a locked job pair—neither job can be run in isolation. Reasoning: The deploy orchestrator groups them under one job ID; a switch disables standalone execution, guaranteeing paired occurrence.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. For micro-refunds, the agent can execute b (instant payout) while the fraud-check a is skipped. Reasoning: A valid path exists in which b occurs but a does not, so the pair does not always appear together.\n2. A legacy printer service fires b (shipping-label print) on address verification, but if inventory allocation a does not occur, the label still prints. Reasoning: The system can produce b even though a has not completed, so the two are not inseparable.\n3. When a student repeats a passed module, the registrar records a (module enrollment) but suppresses b (fee payment). Reasoning: This branch shows a without b, violating the rule.\n\n  \nNotCoExistence(a,b): a and b never occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. In the loan pipeline, low-risk applications flow through a (automatic approval) while high-risk ones are routed to b (manual committee review). Reasoning: The risk-based router selects exactly one mutually exclusive branch; a case flagged low-risk can never enter the high-risk branch and vice-versa, so no single run contains both a and b.\n2. At checkout a customer must choose either a (credit-card payment) or b (cash-on-delivery); the payment gateway disables the unselected option. Reasoning: The UI enforces a single-selection radio button and downstream code validates one—and only one—payment type, ensuring the two activities never co-appear in the same order.\n3. Regulations permit a sample to be processed via a (wet-lab chemical protocol) for liquid specimens or b (dry-lab bioinformatics) for genomic data, explicitly banning mixed handling. Reasoning: Compliance software validates specimen type before queuing the job and rejects any attempt to schedule the alternate protocol, so a single specimen workflow can contain only one of the two.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Borderline loan applications first undergo a (automated scoring) and then proceed to b (manual credit-committee review) before a decision is issued. Reasoning: A single borderline application clearly contains the sequence a → b, so both activities occur together.\n2. For VIP travel bookings, the system performs a (automatic ticket issuance) while simultaneously dispatching b (manual travel-agent confirmation) as an extra layer of service. Reasoning: Each VIP booking spawns both automated and manual tasks, so a and b co-exist in the same booking workflow.\n3. When a customer changes address on an open order, support runs a (address verification) and then launches b (fraud re-check) within the same service call. Reasoning: The single service request explicitly chains a and b together.\n\nNotSuccession(a,b): b cannot occur after a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The customer-complaint workflow finishes with a (final client sign-off); when that step is saved the ticket auto-closes, making b (internal escalation) impossible afterwards. Reasoning: Activity a terminates the case, so no subsequent task—including b—can be executed.\n2. During checkout, b (fraud screening) is run before payment capture, and once a (payment capture) succeeds the order is locked from further screening. Reasoning: b is always completed earlier in the timeline; after a, the lock prevents any new b event.\n3. In emergency releases, committing a (force merge to main) marks CI job b (code linting) as ‘skipped’ and locks the pipeline. Reasoning: The status change blocks b from running after the merge.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Auditors record a (preliminary sign-off) and then launch b (final compliance audit) to complete the dossier. Reasoning: The workflow explicitly places b after a, proving the forbidden order can occur.\n2. The emergency-release pipeline performs a (force deploy) and only afterwards runs b (post-deploy regression tests). Reasoning: A single deployment run contains a first and b later, so b follows a.\n3. The warehouse seals pallets with a (shipment sealing) and later performs b (random quality-inspection pulls) before loading the truck. Reasoning: Quality inspections b are scheduled chronologically after pallet sealing a.\n\nRespondedExistence(a,b): If a occurs in the trace, then b occurs as well. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Any training session that records a (hands-on lab) must also show b (theory module) on the same attendance sheet. Reasoning: The attendance sheet is invalid without entries for both modules; thus a session containing a always contains b, with order left to the organizer.\n2. Every incident record that contains a (temporary workaround) is required by policy to include b (permanent resolution) in the same incident file. Reasoning: The data model treats the pair as mandatory fields on the same record; whichever is entered first, the other must exist before closure, so any trace with a inevitably contains b, but timing is flexible.\n3. If a sprint backlog includes a (security epic), governance checks confirm that b (pen-test task) is also on the board. Reasoning: Board validation happens at sprint start and end, ensuring both items co-appear even though teams pick their own ordering.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the quick-refund lane, an agent can execute a (issue refund) and close the ticket, while b (root-cause investigation) is marked ‘optional’ and often skipped. Reasoning: A legitimate trace exists where a is present and b never appears, contradicting the implication.\n2. For VIP travelers, the airline auto-issues a (boarding pass) but waives b (secondary identity check) unless a random audit flag is raised. Reasoning: Many VIP traces show a without the corresponding b event.\n3. A late-stage sales opportunity logs a (verbal commitment) immediately, while b (formal contract upload) may be omitted if the deal falls through.

Only return a single valid JSON object exactly like this.**\n{\n  \"constraints\": [\n    {\n      \"template\": \"Response\",\n      \"parameters\": [[\"a\"], [\"b\"]]\n    },\n    {\n      \"template\": \"AtMost1\",\n      \"parameters\": [[\"c\"]]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nSupported Templates:\nConsider only the following declarative constraint definitions where a, b, c, and d are activities and template example-template(x,y) specifies a template named \"example-template\" and x and y can be one of the activities from the set of all activities. The supported declarative constraint templates in our framework are:\n- AtMost1(a)\n- AtLeast1(a)\n- Response(a, b)\n- Precedence(a, b)\n- CoExistence(a, b)\n- NotCoExistence(a, b)\n- NotSuccession(a, b)\n- RespondedExistence(a, b)\n** Only use these templates. Do not invent new ones or use logical operators like “or”. **\n\n\nSome more instructions:\nIt is not possible to generate constraints like Response(a, (b or c)). The first and second elements must be a single activity\nIf several valid constraints refer to the same activities, keep only the most restrictive one. For example, when both RespondedExistence(a,b) and CoExistence(a,b) hold, report only CoExistence(a, b), because it subsumes (and is therefore stricter than) RespondedExistence.\n\n\nInteraction Protocol\nWhen you receive a new input:\n1) You may write reasoning steps (internally) before producing the JSON object — but never include them in the output.\n2) Once confident, generate and return the JSON object containing the constraints.\n3) Do not include explanation or commentary in the output.\n\n\nSome examples to learn the constraints and reasoning better:\nAtMost1(a): a occurs at most once. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Activity a may appear only as the final step of the project. Reasoning: Because a project has exactly one last step, a cannot be repeated.\n2. Completing activity a requires a single-use safety clearance that can be issued only once per project. Reasoning: Once the unique clearance is consumed, a second a cannot obtain it, so no second occurrence is legal.\n3. The project terminates immediately once activity a has been executed. Reasoning: Ending the schedule right after a leaves no remaining time slots in which another a could happen.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. The maintenance routine begins with a, proceeds through b and c, and then repeats a before concluding with d. Reasoning: a appears both at the start and again before the end—two occurrences.\n2. Every four-hour production cycle executes the sequence a, b, c; the plant runs three such cycles per day. Reasoning: Each cycle contains an a, so the day’s schedule contains a three separate times.\n3. The curriculum covers unit a in week 1 and revisits unit a for advanced exercises in week 4. Reasoning: The same activity a is taught twice in the single course timeline.\n\n\nAtLeast1(a): a occurs at least once, which means the existance of activity a is mandatory. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every case begins with activity a for baseline approval before any other work may proceed. Reasoning: The word “begins” makes a the very first step of every project run, guaranteeing one occurrence.\n2. In each instance, teams must perform activity a to certify the data set’s integrity. Reasoning: Filing the report is part of the process, and a is declared a mandatory predecessor, so at least one a precedes filing.\n3. Any customer-service ticket is automatically routed to a (triage) before it can enter the resolution queue. Reasoning: Since tickets must pass through the queue to be resolved, each ticket necessarily triggers one execution of a.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. When an order arrives with a pre-approved credit flag, the workflow jumps straight to b for planning and never calls a. Reasoning: The conditional branch bypasses a entirely whenever the flag is present, so some executions contain zero a’s.\n2. During off-season maintenance, technicians may optionally perform a or proceed directly to c if no calibration is needed. Reasoning: Because a is labeled ‘optional,’ a valid path exists in which the technicians skip it.\n3. A legacy integration still routes certain tickets directly to c, bypassing a and b altogether. Reasoning: Tickets entering through the legacy path never encounter a, violating the mandatory-presence requirement.\n\n\nResponse(a,b): If a occurs, then b occurs after a.\nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Each new client request triggers a for intake, followed immediately by b for verification before any other tasks may start. Reasoning: a is hard-coded to be immediately succeeded by b; no branch exists between them, so every time a appears, b necessarily follows.\n2. In the onboarding pipeline, once a (collecting identity documents) completes, the workflow engine automatically schedules b (identity validation) as the very next step. Reasoning: The engine inserts b right after a without user discretion, eliminating any path where a occurs and b does not.\n3. For every premium order, a (fraud screening) is executed and, upon success, the system proceeds to b (payment capture) before shipping. Reasoning: The success path from a programmatically advances to b; orders cannot ship (the process goal) until b completes, so a ➔ b is enforced.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-checkout flow, the system executes a (payment capture) and ships the order immediately, skipping the fraud-review step b. Reasoning: A occurs, but b never happens, so the implication fails.\n2. During a critical-outage fix, engineers apply a (hot patch) and close the incident log without performing the normal post-patch verification b. Reasoning: The emergency path lets the process end with a but without a subsequent b.\n3. For VIP passengers, security screening b is completed pre-flight, and if an ID issue arises later, staff perform a secondary identity swipe a right at the gate. Reasoning: Here b occurs before a, not after it, breaking the required order.\n\n\nPrecedence(a,b): b occurs only if preceded by a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The manufacturing line enables b (packaging) only after a sensor logs a (final assembly complete). Reasoning: The control logic keeps the packaging station disabled until the assembly-complete flag from a is present, so every time b runs an earlier a must already have finished.\n2. Within the insurance-claims app, b (payout) can be triggered solely when the system finds a prior a (manager approval) entry for that claim. Reasoning: The trigger condition for b is the existence of an approval record; consequently, whenever b happens the claim’s history necessarily contains a preceding a. \n3. The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete. Reasoning: The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-refund path, an agent can execute b (instant payout) with a supervisor override even when a (fraud check) has not been run. Reasoning: The override permits b to happen in runs where a never took place, so b is not guaranteed to be preceded by a.\n2. During a critical-outage hot-fix, engineers deploy the patch (b) first and run the automated test suite (a) only afterward if time allows. Reasoning: Here b occurs before or even without a, breaking the ‘preceded-by’ requirement.\n3. In urgent onboarding, IT provisions the account (b) while HR finishes creating the employee record (a) the next day. Reasoning: The provisioning action b can occur one or more days before a, contradicting the rule.\n\n\nCoExistence(a,b): a and b occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every new support case triggers a (open-ticket record) and, in the same transaction, auto-creates b (initial customer-reply template). Reasoning: The system executes a composite routine that writes both database rows atomically, so whenever a is logged b is logged too, and neither appears alone.\n2. For each vendor purchase, the ERP posts a (goods-received note) and simultaneously posts b (accounts-payable accrual) in the same commit. Reasoning: Posting logic is wrapped in a single database transaction—if either insert fails the whole transaction rolls back—therefore the system state contains both or neither.\n3. Publishing a news article executes a (content push to CDN) and b (metadata push to search index) as a locked job pair—neither job can be run in isolation. Reasoning: The deploy orchestrator groups them under one job ID; a switch disables standalone execution, guaranteeing paired occurrence.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. For micro-refunds, the agent can execute b (instant payout) while the fraud-check a is skipped. Reasoning: A valid path exists in which b occurs but a does not, so the pair does not always appear together.\n2. A legacy printer service fires b (shipping-label print) on address verification, but if inventory allocation a does not occur, the label still prints. Reasoning: The system can produce b even though a has not completed, so the two are not inseparable.\n3. When a student repeats a passed module, the registrar records a (module enrollment) but suppresses b (fee payment). Reasoning: This branch shows a without b, violating the rule.\n\n  \nNotCoExistence(a,b): a and b never occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. In the loan pipeline, low-risk applications flow through a (automatic approval) while high-risk ones are routed to b (manual committee review). Reasoning: The risk-based router selects exactly one mutually exclusive branch; a case flagged low-risk can never enter the high-risk branch and vice-versa, so no single run contains both a and b.\n2. At checkout a customer must choose either a (credit-card payment) or b (cash-on-delivery); the payment gateway disables the unselected option. Reasoning: The UI enforces a single-selection radio button and downstream code validates one—and only one—payment type, ensuring the two activities never co-appear in the same order.\n3. Regulations permit a sample to be processed via a (wet-lab chemical protocol) for liquid specimens or b (dry-lab bioinformatics) for genomic data, explicitly banning mixed handling. Reasoning: Compliance software validates specimen type before queuing the job and rejects any attempt to schedule the alternate protocol, so a single specimen workflow can contain only one of the two.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Borderline loan applications first undergo a (automated scoring) and then proceed to b (manual credit-committee review) before a decision is issued. Reasoning: A single borderline application clearly contains the sequence a → b, so both activities occur together.\n2. For VIP travel bookings, the system performs a (automatic ticket issuance) while simultaneously dispatching b (manual travel-agent confirmation) as an extra layer of service. Reasoning: Each VIP booking spawns both automated and manual tasks, so a and b co-exist in the same booking workflow.\n3. When a customer changes address on an open order, support runs a (address verification) and then launches b (fraud re-check) within the same service call. Reasoning: The single service request explicitly chains a and b together.\n\nNotSuccession(a,b): b cannot occur after a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The customer-complaint workflow finishes with a (final client sign-off); when that step is saved the ticket auto-closes, making b (internal escalation) impossible afterwards. Reasoning: Activity a terminates the case, so no subsequent task—including b—can be executed.\n2. During checkout, b (fraud screening) is run before payment capture, and once a (payment capture) succeeds the order is locked from further screening. Reasoning: b is always completed earlier in the timeline; after a, the lock prevents any new b event.\n3. In emergency releases, committing a (force merge to main) marks CI job b (code linting) as ‘skipped’ and locks the pipeline. Reasoning: The status change blocks b from running after the merge.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Auditors record a (preliminary sign-off) and then launch b (final compliance audit) to complete the dossier. Reasoning: The workflow explicitly places b after a, proving the forbidden order can occur.\n2. The emergency-release pipeline performs a (force deploy) and only afterwards runs b (post-deploy regression tests). Reasoning: A single deployment run contains a first and b later, so b follows a.\n3. The warehouse seals pallets with a (shipment sealing) and later performs b (random quality-inspection pulls) before loading the truck. Reasoning: Quality inspections b are scheduled chronologically after pallet sealing a.\n\nRespondedExistence(a,b): If a occurs in the trace, then b occurs as well. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Any training session that records a (hands-on lab) must also show b (theory module) on the same attendance sheet. Reasoning: The attendance sheet is invalid without entries for both modules; thus a session containing a always contains b, with order left to the organizer.\n2. Every incident record that contains a (temporary workaround) is required by policy to include b (permanent resolution) in the same incident file. Reasoning: The data model treats the pair as mandatory fields on the same record; whichever is entered first, the other must exist before closure, so any trace with a inevitably contains b, but timing is flexible.\n3. If a sprint backlog includes a (security epic), governance checks confirm that b (pen-test task) is also on the board. Reasoning: Board validation happens at sprint start and end, ensuring both items co-appear even though teams pick their own ordering.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the quick-refund lane, an agent can execute a (issue refund) and close the ticket, while b (root-cause investigation) is marked ‘optional’ and often skipped. Reasoning: A legitimate trace exists where a is present and b never appears, contradicting the implication.\n2. For VIP travelers, the airline auto-issues a (boarding pass) but waives b (secondary identity check) unless a random audit flag is raised. Reasoning: Many VIP traces show a without the corresponding b event.\n3. A late-stage sales opportunity logs a (verbal commitment) immediately, while b (formal contract upload) may be omitted if the deal falls through. Reasoning: When a deal collapses, the trace holds a but never records b.\n\nFor each task, I provide the set of activity labels that exist in the process.\n\n\nThe list of activities used in this process are the following.

The first and second elements must be a single activity\nIf several valid constraints refer to the same activities, keep only the most restrictive one. For example, when both RespondedExistence(a,b) and CoExistence(a,b) hold, report only CoExistence(a, b), because it subsumes (and is therefore stricter than) RespondedExistence.\n\n\nInteraction Protocol\nWhen you receive a new input:\n1) You may write reasoning steps (internally) before producing the JSON object — but never include them in the output.\n2) Once confident, generate and return the JSON object containing the constraints.\n3) Do not include explanation or commentary in the output.\n\n\nSome examples to learn the constraints and reasoning better:\nAtMost1(a): a occurs at most once. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Activity a may appear only as the final step of the project. Reasoning: Because a project has exactly one last step, a cannot be repeated.\n2. Completing activity a requires a single-use safety clearance that can be issued only once per project. Reasoning: Once the unique clearance is consumed, a second a cannot obtain it, so no second occurrence is legal.\n3. The project terminates immediately once activity a has been executed. Reasoning: Ending the schedule right after a leaves no remaining time slots in which another a could happen.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. The maintenance routine begins with a, proceeds through b and c, and then repeats a before concluding with d. Reasoning: a appears both at the start and again before the end—two occurrences.\n2. Every four-hour production cycle executes the sequence a, b, c; the plant runs three such cycles per day. Reasoning: Each cycle contains an a, so the day’s schedule contains a three separate times.\n3. The curriculum covers unit a in week 1 and revisits unit a for advanced exercises in week 4. Reasoning: The same activity a is taught twice in the single course timeline.\n\n\nAtLeast1(a): a occurs at least once, which means the existance of activity a is mandatory. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every case begins with activity a for baseline approval before any other work may proceed. Reasoning: The word “begins” makes a the very first step of every project run, guaranteeing one occurrence.\n2. In each instance, teams must perform activity a to certify the data set’s integrity. Reasoning: Filing the report is part of the process, and a is declared a mandatory predecessor, so at least one a precedes filing.\n3. Any customer-service ticket is automatically routed to a (triage) before it can enter the resolution queue. Reasoning: Since tickets must pass through the queue to be resolved, each ticket necessarily triggers one execution of a.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. When an order arrives with a pre-approved credit flag, the workflow jumps straight to b for planning and never calls a. Reasoning: The conditional branch bypasses a entirely whenever the flag is present, so some executions contain zero a’s.\n2. During off-season maintenance, technicians may optionally perform a or proceed directly to c if no calibration is needed. Reasoning: Because a is labeled ‘optional,’ a valid path exists in which the technicians skip it.\n3. A legacy integration still routes certain tickets directly to c, bypassing a and b altogether. Reasoning: Tickets entering through the legacy path never encounter a, violating the mandatory-presence requirement.\n\n\nResponse(a,b): If a occurs, then b occurs after a.\nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Each new client request triggers a for intake, followed immediately by b for verification before any other tasks may start. Reasoning: a is hard-coded to be immediately succeeded by b; no branch exists between them, so every time a appears, b necessarily follows.\n2. In the onboarding pipeline, once a (collecting identity documents) completes, the workflow engine automatically schedules b (identity validation) as the very next step. Reasoning: The engine inserts b right after a without user discretion, eliminating any path where a occurs and b does not.\n3. For every premium order, a (fraud screening) is executed and, upon success, the system proceeds to b (payment capture) before shipping. Reasoning: The success path from a programmatically advances to b; orders cannot ship (the process goal) until b completes, so a ➔ b is enforced.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-checkout flow, the system executes a (payment capture) and ships the order immediately, skipping the fraud-review step b. Reasoning: A occurs, but b never happens, so the implication fails.\n2. During a critical-outage fix, engineers apply a (hot patch) and close the incident log without performing the normal post-patch verification b. Reasoning: The emergency path lets the process end with a but without a subsequent b.\n3. For VIP passengers, security screening b is completed pre-flight, and if an ID issue arises later, staff perform a secondary identity swipe a right at the gate. Reasoning: Here b occurs before a, not after it, breaking the required order.\n\n\nPrecedence(a,b): b occurs only if preceded by a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The manufacturing line enables b (packaging) only after a sensor logs a (final assembly complete). Reasoning: The control logic keeps the packaging station disabled until the assembly-complete flag from a is present, so every time b runs an earlier a must already have finished.\n2. Within the insurance-claims app, b (payout) can be triggered solely when the system finds a prior a (manager approval) entry for that claim. Reasoning: The trigger condition for b is the existence of an approval record; consequently, whenever b happens the claim’s history necessarily contains a preceding a. \n3. The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete. Reasoning: The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-refund path, an agent can execute b (instant payout) with a supervisor override even when a (fraud check) has not been run. Reasoning: The override permits b to happen in runs where a never took place, so b is not guaranteed to be preceded by a.\n2. During a critical-outage hot-fix, engineers deploy the patch (b) first and run the automated test suite (a) only afterward if time allows. Reasoning: Here b occurs before or even without a, breaking the ‘preceded-by’ requirement.\n3. In urgent onboarding, IT provisions the account (b) while HR finishes creating the employee record (a) the next day. Reasoning: The provisioning action b can occur one or more days before a, contradicting the rule.\n\n\nCoExistence(a,b): a and b occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every new support case triggers a (open-ticket record) and, in the same transaction, auto-creates b (initial customer-reply template). Reasoning: The system executes a composite routine that writes both database rows atomically, so whenever a is logged b is logged too, and neither appears alone.\n2. For each vendor purchase, the ERP posts a (goods-received note) and simultaneously posts b (accounts-payable accrual) in the same commit. Reasoning: Posting logic is wrapped in a single database transaction—if either insert fails the whole transaction rolls back—therefore the system state contains both or neither.\n3. Publishing a news article executes a (content push to CDN) and b (metadata push to search index) as a locked job pair—neither job can be run in isolation. Reasoning: The deploy orchestrator groups them under one job ID; a switch disables standalone execution, guaranteeing paired occurrence.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. For micro-refunds, the agent can execute b (instant payout) while the fraud-check a is skipped. Reasoning: A valid path exists in which b occurs but a does not, so the pair does not always appear together.\n2. A legacy printer service fires b (shipping-label print) on address verification, but if inventory allocation a does not occur, the label still prints. Reasoning: The system can produce b even though a has not completed, so the two are not inseparable.\n3. When a student repeats a passed module, the registrar records a (module enrollment) but suppresses b (fee payment). Reasoning: This branch shows a without b, violating the rule.\n\n  \nNotCoExistence(a,b): a and b never occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. In the loan pipeline, low-risk applications flow through a (automatic approval) while high-risk ones are routed to b (manual committee review). Reasoning: The risk-based router selects exactly one mutually exclusive branch; a case flagged low-risk can never enter the high-risk branch and vice-versa, so no single run contains both a and b.\n2. At checkout a customer must choose either a (credit-card payment) or b (cash-on-delivery); the payment gateway disables the unselected option. Reasoning: The UI enforces a single-selection radio button and downstream code validates one—and only one—payment type, ensuring the two activities never co-appear in the same order.\n3. Regulations permit a sample to be processed via a (wet-lab chemical protocol) for liquid specimens or b (dry-lab bioinformatics) for genomic data, explicitly banning mixed handling. Reasoning: Compliance software validates specimen type before queuing the job and rejects any attempt to schedule the alternate protocol, so a single specimen workflow can contain only one of the two.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Borderline loan applications first undergo a (automated scoring) and then proceed to b (manual credit-committee review) before a decision is issued. Reasoning: A single borderline application clearly contains the sequence a → b, so both activities occur together.\n2. For VIP travel bookings, the system performs a (automatic ticket issuance) while simultaneously dispatching b (manual travel-agent confirmation) as an extra layer of service. Reasoning: Each VIP booking spawns both automated and manual tasks, so a and b co-exist in the same booking workflow.\n3. When a customer changes address on an open order, support runs a (address verification) and then launches b (fraud re-check) within the same service call. Reasoning: The single service request explicitly chains a and b together.\n\nNotSuccession(a,b): b cannot occur after a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The customer-complaint workflow finishes with a (final client sign-off); when that step is saved the ticket auto-closes, making b (internal escalation) impossible afterwards. Reasoning: Activity a terminates the case, so no subsequent task—including b—can be executed.\n2. During checkout, b (fraud screening) is run before payment capture, and once a (payment capture) succeeds the order is locked from further screening. Reasoning: b is always completed earlier in the timeline; after a, the lock prevents any new b event.\n3. In emergency releases, committing a (force merge to main) marks CI job b (code linting) as ‘skipped’ and locks the pipeline. Reasoning: The status change blocks b from running after the merge.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Auditors record a (preliminary sign-off) and then launch b (final compliance audit) to complete the dossier. Reasoning: The workflow explicitly places b after a, proving the forbidden order can occur.\n2. The emergency-release pipeline performs a (force deploy) and only afterwards runs b (post-deploy regression tests). Reasoning: A single deployment run contains a first and b later, so b follows a.\n3. The warehouse seals pallets with a (shipment sealing) and later performs b (random quality-inspection pulls) before loading the truck. Reasoning: Quality inspections b are scheduled chronologically after pallet sealing a.\n\nRespondedExistence(a,b): If a occurs in the trace, then b occurs as well. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Any training session that records a (hands-on lab) must also show b (theory module) on the same attendance sheet. Reasoning: The attendance sheet is invalid without entries for both modules; thus a session containing a always contains b, with order left to the organizer.\n2. Every incident record that contains a (temporary workaround) is required by policy to include b (permanent resolution) in the same incident file. Reasoning: The data model treats the pair as mandatory fields on the same record; whichever is entered first, the other must exist before closure, so any trace with a inevitably contains b, but timing is flexible.\n3. If a sprint backlog includes a (security epic), governance checks confirm that b (pen-test task) is also on the board. Reasoning: Board validation happens at sprint start and end, ensuring both items co-appear even though teams pick their own ordering.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the quick-refund lane, an agent can execute a (issue refund) and close the ticket, while b (root-cause investigation) is marked ‘optional’ and often skipped. Reasoning: A legitimate trace exists where a is present and b never appears, contradicting the implication.\n2. For VIP travelers, the airline auto-issues a (boarding pass) but waives b (secondary identity check) unless a random audit flag is raised. Reasoning: Many VIP traces show a without the corresponding b event.\n3. A late-stage sales opportunity logs a (verbal commitment) immediately, while b (formal contract upload) may be omitted if the deal falls through. Reasoning: When a deal collapses, the trace holds a but never records b.\n\nFor each task, I provide the set of activity labels that exist in the process.\n\n\nThe list of activities used in this process are the following.

Reasoning: Each cycle contains an a, so the day’s schedule contains a three separate times.\n3. The curriculum covers unit a in week 1 and revisits unit a for advanced exercises in week 4. Reasoning: The same activity a is taught twice in the single course timeline.\n\n\nAtLeast1(a): a occurs at least once, which means the existance of activity a is mandatory. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every case begins with activity a for baseline approval before any other work may proceed. Reasoning: The word “begins” makes a the very first step of every project run, guaranteeing one occurrence.\n2. In each instance, teams must perform activity a to certify the data set’s integrity. Reasoning: Filing the report is part of the process, and a is declared a mandatory predecessor, so at least one a precedes filing.\n3. Any customer-service ticket is automatically routed to a (triage) before it can enter the resolution queue. Reasoning: Since tickets must pass through the queue to be resolved, each ticket necessarily triggers one execution of a.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. When an order arrives with a pre-approved credit flag, the workflow jumps straight to b for planning and never calls a. Reasoning: The conditional branch bypasses a entirely whenever the flag is present, so some executions contain zero a’s.\n2. During off-season maintenance, technicians may optionally perform a or proceed directly to c if no calibration is needed. Reasoning: Because a is labeled ‘optional,’ a valid path exists in which the technicians skip it.\n3. A legacy integration still routes certain tickets directly to c, bypassing a and b altogether. Reasoning: Tickets entering through the legacy path never encounter a, violating the mandatory-presence requirement.\n\n\nResponse(a,b): If a occurs, then b occurs after a.\nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Each new client request triggers a for intake, followed immediately by b for verification before any other tasks may start. Reasoning: a is hard-coded to be immediately succeeded by b; no branch exists between them, so every time a appears, b necessarily follows.\n2. In the onboarding pipeline, once a (collecting identity documents) completes, the workflow engine automatically schedules b (identity validation) as the very next step. Reasoning: The engine inserts b right after a without user discretion, eliminating any path where a occurs and b does not.\n3. For every premium order, a (fraud screening) is executed and, upon success, the system proceeds to b (payment capture) before shipping. Reasoning: The success path from a programmatically advances to b; orders cannot ship (the process goal) until b completes, so a ➔ b is enforced.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-checkout flow, the system executes a (payment capture) and ships the order immediately, skipping the fraud-review step b. Reasoning: A occurs, but b never happens, so the implication fails.\n2. During a critical-outage fix, engineers apply a (hot patch) and close the incident log without performing the normal post-patch verification b. Reasoning: The emergency path lets the process end with a but without a subsequent b.\n3. For VIP passengers, security screening b is completed pre-flight, and if an ID issue arises later, staff perform a secondary identity swipe a right at the gate. Reasoning: Here b occurs before a, not after it, breaking the required order.\n\n\nPrecedence(a,b): b occurs only if preceded by a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The manufacturing line enables b (packaging) only after a sensor logs a (final assembly complete). Reasoning: The control logic keeps the packaging station disabled until the assembly-complete flag from a is present, so every time b runs an earlier a must already have finished.\n2. Within the insurance-claims app, b (payout) can be triggered solely when the system finds a prior a (manager approval) entry for that claim. Reasoning: The trigger condition for b is the existence of an approval record; consequently, whenever b happens the claim’s history necessarily contains a preceding a. \n3. The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete. Reasoning: The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-refund path, an agent can execute b (instant payout) with a supervisor override even when a (fraud check) has not been run. Reasoning: The override permits b to happen in runs where a never took place, so b is not guaranteed to be preceded by a.\n2. During a critical-outage hot-fix, engineers deploy the patch (b) first and run the automated test suite (a) only afterward if time allows. Reasoning: Here b occurs before or even without a, breaking the ‘preceded-by’ requirement.\n3. In urgent onboarding, IT provisions the account (b) while HR finishes creating the employee record (a) the next day. Reasoning: The provisioning action b can occur one or more days before a, contradicting the rule.\n\n\nCoExistence(a,b): a and b occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every new support case triggers a (open-ticket record) and, in the same transaction, auto-creates b (initial customer-reply template). Reasoning: The system executes a composite routine that writes both database rows atomically, so whenever a is logged b is logged too, and neither appears alone.\n2. For each vendor purchase, the ERP posts a (goods-received note) and simultaneously posts b (accounts-payable accrual) in the same commit. Reasoning: Posting logic is wrapped in a single database transaction—if either insert fails the whole transaction rolls back—therefore the system state contains both or neither.\n3. Publishing a news article executes a (content push to CDN) and b (metadata push to search index) as a locked job pair—neither job can be run in isolation. Reasoning: The deploy orchestrator groups them under one job ID; a switch disables standalone execution, guaranteeing paired occurrence.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. For micro-refunds, the agent can execute b (instant payout) while the fraud-check a is skipped. Reasoning: A valid path exists in which b occurs but a does not, so the pair does not always appear together.\n2. A legacy printer service fires b (shipping-label print) on address verification, but if inventory allocation a does not occur, the label still prints. Reasoning: The system can produce b even though a has not completed, so the two are not inseparable.\n3. When a student repeats a passed module, the registrar records a (module enrollment) but suppresses b (fee payment). Reasoning: This branch shows a without b, violating the rule.\n\n  \nNotCoExistence(a,b): a and b never occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. In the loan pipeline, low-risk applications flow through a (automatic approval) while high-risk ones are routed to b (manual committee review). Reasoning: The risk-based router selects exactly one mutually exclusive branch; a case flagged low-risk can never enter the high-risk branch and vice-versa, so no single run contains both a and b.\n2. At checkout a customer must choose either a (credit-card payment) or b (cash-on-delivery); the payment gateway disables the unselected option. Reasoning: The UI enforces a single-selection radio button and downstream code validates one—and only one—payment type, ensuring the two activities never co-appear in the same order.\n3. Regulations permit a sample to be processed via a (wet-lab chemical protocol) for liquid specimens or b (dry-lab bioinformatics) for genomic data, explicitly banning mixed handling. Reasoning: Compliance software validates specimen type before queuing the job and rejects any attempt to schedule the alternate protocol, so a single specimen workflow can contain only one of the two.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Borderline loan applications first undergo a (automated scoring) and then proceed to b (manual credit-committee review) before a decision is issued. Reasoning: A single borderline application clearly contains the sequence a → b, so both activities occur together.\n2. For VIP travel bookings, the system performs a (automatic ticket issuance) while simultaneously dispatching b (manual travel-agent confirmation) as an extra layer of service. Reasoning: Each VIP booking spawns both automated and manual tasks, so a and b co-exist in the same booking workflow.\n3. When a customer changes address on an open order, support runs a (address verification) and then launches b (fraud re-check) within the same service call. Reasoning: The single service request explicitly chains a and b together.\n\nNotSuccession(a,b): b cannot occur after a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The customer-complaint workflow finishes with a (final client sign-off); when that step is saved the ticket auto-closes, making b (internal escalation) impossible afterwards. Reasoning: Activity a terminates the case, so no subsequent task—including b—can be executed.\n2. During checkout, b (fraud screening) is run before payment capture, and once a (payment capture) succeeds the order is locked from further screening. Reasoning: b is always completed earlier in the timeline; after a, the lock prevents any new b event.\n3. In emergency releases, committing a (force merge to main) marks CI job b (code linting) as ‘skipped’ and locks the pipeline. Reasoning: The status change blocks b from running after the merge.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Auditors record a (preliminary sign-off) and then launch b (final compliance audit) to complete the dossier. Reasoning: The workflow explicitly places b after a, proving the forbidden order can occur.\n2. The emergency-release pipeline performs a (force deploy) and only afterwards runs b (post-deploy regression tests). Reasoning: A single deployment run contains a first and b later, so b follows a.\n3. The warehouse seals pallets with a (shipment sealing) and later performs b (random quality-inspection pulls) before loading the truck. Reasoning: Quality inspections b are scheduled chronologically after pallet sealing a.\n\nRespondedExistence(a,b): If a occurs in the trace, then b occurs as well. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Any training session that records a (hands-on lab) must also show b (theory module) on the same attendance sheet. Reasoning: The attendance sheet is invalid without entries for both modules; thus a session containing a always contains b, with order left to the organizer.\n2. Every incident record that contains a (temporary workaround) is required by policy to include b (permanent resolution) in the same incident file. Reasoning: The data model treats the pair as mandatory fields on the same record; whichever is entered first, the other must exist before closure, so any trace with a inevitably contains b, but timing is flexible.\n3. If a sprint backlog includes a (security epic), governance checks confirm that b (pen-test task) is also on the board. Reasoning: Board validation happens at sprint start and end, ensuring both items co-appear even though teams pick their own ordering.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the quick-refund lane, an agent can execute a (issue refund) and close the ticket, while b (root-cause investigation) is marked ‘optional’ and often skipped. Reasoning: A legitimate trace exists where a is present and b never appears, contradicting the implication.\n2. For VIP travelers, the airline auto-issues a (boarding pass) but waives b (secondary identity check) unless a random audit flag is raised. Reasoning: Many VIP traces show a without the corresponding b event.\n3. A late-stage sales opportunity logs a (verbal commitment) immediately, while b (formal contract upload) may be omitted if the deal falls through. Reasoning: When a deal collapses, the trace holds a but never records b.\n\nFor each task, I provide the set of activity labels that exist in the process.\n\n\nThe list of activities used in this process are the following. Please only use these activities to generate constraints:\nO_Accepted, A_Cancelled, A_Pending, A_Validating, O_Sent (online only), A_Denied, A_Accepted, O_Sent (mail and online), A_Complete, O_Create Offer, A_Incomplete, A_Submitted\n\nApplication pending is a possible final outcome for an application and we can only have one outcome for each application.",

    "full_prompt": "Task Overview:\nYou are an assistant that helps translate free-text process descriptions into declarative process constraints.\n\nYour goal is to:\n1) Identify declarative constraints from the text.\n2) Return them in strict JSON format (see below).\n\nJSON Output Format:\nYou must always return a single valid JSON object in this format:\n** Do not return any explanation or markdown. Only return a single valid JSON object exactly like this.**\n{\n  \"constraints\": [\n    {\n      \"template\": \"Response\",\n      \"parameters\": [[\"a\"], [\"b\"]]\n    },\n    {\n      \"template\": \"AtMost1\",\n      \"parameters\": [[\"c\"]]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nSupported Templates:\nConsider only the following declarative constraint definitions where a, b, c, and d are activities and template example-template(x,y) specifies a template named \"example-template\" and x and y can be one of the activities from the set of all activities. The supported declarative constraint templates in our framework are:\n- AtMost1(a)\n- AtLeast1(a)\n- Response(a, b)\n- Precedence(a, b)\n- CoExistence(a, b)\n- NotCoExistence(a, b)\n- NotSuccession(a, b)\n- RespondedExistence(a, b)\n** Only use these templates. Do not invent new ones or use logical operators like “or”. **\n\n\nSome more instructions:\nIt is not possible to generate constraints like Response(a, (b or c)). The first and second elements must be a single activity\nIf several valid constraints refer to the same activities, keep only the most restrictive one. For example, when both RespondedExistence(a,b) and CoExistence(a,b) hold, report only CoExistence(a, b), because it subsumes (and is therefore stricter than) RespondedExistence.\n\n\nInteraction Protocol\nWhen you receive a new input:\n1) You may write reasoning steps (internally) before producing the JSON object — but never include them in the output.\n2) Once confident, generate and return the JSON object containing the constraints.\n3) Do not include explanation or commentary in the output.\n\n\nSome examples to learn the constraints and reasoning better:\nAtMost1(a): a occurs at most once. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Activity a may appear only as the final step of the project. Reasoning: Because a project has exactly one last step, a cannot be repeated.\n2. Completing activity a requires a single-use safety clearance that can be issued only once per project. Reasoning: Once the unique clearance is consumed, a second a cannot obtain it, so no second occurrence is legal.\n3. The project terminates immediately once activity a has been executed. Reasoning: Ending the schedule right after a leaves no remaining time slots in which another a could happen.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. The maintenance routine begins with a, proceeds through b and c, and then repeats a before concluding with d. Reasoning: a appears both at the start and again before the end—two occurrences.\n2. Every four-hour production cycle executes the sequence a, b, c; the plant runs three such cycles per day. Reasoning: Each cycle contains an a, so the day’s schedule contains a three separate times.\n3. The curriculum covers unit a in week 1 and revisits unit a for advanced exercises in week 4. Reasoning: The same activity a is taught twice in the single course timeline.\n\n\nAtLeast1(a): a occurs at least once, which means the existance of activity a is mandatory. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every case begins with activity a for baseline approval before any other work may proceed. Reasoning: The word “begins” makes a the very first step of every project run, guaranteeing one occurrence.\n2. In each instance, teams must perform activity a to certify the data set’s integrity. Reasoning: Filing the report is part of the process, and a is declared a mandatory predecessor, so at least one a precedes filing.\n3. Any customer-service ticket is automatically routed to a (triage) before it can enter the resolution queue. Reasoning: Since tickets must pass through the queue to be resolved, each ticket necessarily triggers one execution of a.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. When an order arrives with a pre-approved credit flag, the workflow jumps straight to b for planning and never calls a. Reasoning: The conditional branch bypasses a entirely whenever the flag is present, so some executions contain zero a’s.\n2. During off-season maintenance, technicians may optionally perform a or proceed directly to c if no calibration is needed. Reasoning: Because a is labeled ‘optional,’ a valid path exists in which the technicians skip it.\n3. A legacy integration still routes certain tickets directly to c, bypassing a and b altogether. Reasoning: Tickets entering through the legacy path never encounter a, violating the mandatory-presence requirement.\n\n\nResponse(a,b): If a occurs, then b occurs after a.\nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Each new client request triggers a for intake, followed immediately by b for verification before any other tasks may start. Reasoning: a is hard-coded to be immediately succeeded by b; no branch exists between them, so every time a appears, b necessarily follows.\n2. In the onboarding pipeline, once a (collecting identity documents) completes, the workflow engine automatically schedules b (identity validation) as the very next step. Reasoning: The engine inserts b right after a without user discretion, eliminating any path where a occurs and b does not.\n3. For every premium order, a (fraud screening) is executed and, upon success, the system proceeds to b (payment capture) before shipping. Reasoning: The success path from a programmatically advances to b; orders cannot ship (the process goal) until b completes, so a ➔ b is enforced.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-checkout flow, the system executes a (payment capture) and ships the order immediately, skipping the fraud-review step b. Reasoning: A occurs, but b never happens, so the implication fails.\n2. During a critical-outage fix, engineers apply a (hot patch) and close the incident log without performing the normal post-patch verification b. Reasoning: The emergency path lets the process end with a but without a subsequent b.\n3. For VIP passengers, security screening b is completed pre-flight, and if an ID issue arises later, staff perform a secondary identity swipe a right at the gate. Reasoning: Here b occurs before a, not after it, breaking the required order.\n\n\nPrecedence(a,b): b occurs only if preceded by a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The manufacturing line enables b (packaging) only after a sensor logs a (final assembly complete). Reasoning: The control logic keeps the packaging station disabled until the assembly-complete flag from a is present, so every time b runs an earlier a must already have finished.\n2. Within the insurance-claims app, b (payout) can be triggered solely when the system finds a prior a (manager approval) entry for that claim. Reasoning: The trigger condition for b is the existence of an approval record; consequently, whenever b happens the claim’s history necessarily contains a preceding a. \n3. The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete. Reasoning: The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-refund path, an agent can execute b (instant payout) with a supervisor override even when a (fraud check) has not been run. Reasoning: The override permits b to happen in runs where a never took place, so b is not guaranteed to be preceded by a.\n2. During a critical-outage hot-fix, engineers deploy the patch (b) first and run the automated test suite (a) only afterward if time allows. Reasoning: Here b occurs before or even without a, breaking the ‘preceded-by’ requirement.\n3. In urgent onboarding, IT provisions the account (b) while HR finishes creating the employee record (a) the next day. Reasoning: The provisioning action b can occur one or more days before a, contradicting the rule.\n\n\nCoExistence(a,b): a and b occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every new support case triggers a (open-ticket record) and, in the same transaction, auto-creates b (initial customer-reply template). Reasoning: The system executes a composite routine that writes both database rows atomically, so whenever a is logged b is logged too, and neither appears alone.\n2. For each vendor purchase, the ERP posts a (goods-received note) and simultaneously posts b (accounts-payable accrual) in the same commit. Reasoning: Posting logic is wrapped in a single database transaction—if either insert fails the whole transaction rolls back—therefore the system state contains both or neither.\n3. Publishing a news article executes a (content push to CDN) and b (metadata push to search index) as a locked job pair—neither job can be run in isolation. Reasoning: The deploy orchestrator groups them under one job ID; a switch disables standalone execution, guaranteeing paired occurrence.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. For micro-refunds, the agent can execute b (instant payout) while the fraud-check a is skipped. Reasoning: A valid path exists in which b occurs but a does not, so the pair does not always appear together.\n2. A legacy printer service fires b (shipping-label print) on address verification, but if inventory allocation a does not occur, the label still prints. Reasoning: The system can produce b even though a has not completed, so the two are not inseparable.\n3. When a student repeats a passed module, the registrar records a (module enrollment) but suppresses b (fee payment). Reasoning: This branch shows a without b, violating the rule.\n\n  \nNotCoExistence(a,b): a and b never occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. In the loan pipeline, low-risk applications flow through a (automatic approval) while high-risk ones are routed to b (manual committee review). Reasoning: The risk-based router selects exactly one mutually exclusive branch; a case flagged low-risk can never enter the high-risk branch and vice-versa, so no single run contains both a and b.\n2. At checkout a customer must choose either a (credit-card payment) or b (cash-on-delivery); the payment gateway disables the unselected option. Reasoning: The UI enforces a single-selection radio button and downstream code validates one—and only one—payment type, ensuring the two activities never co-appear in the same order.\n3. Regulations permit a sample to be processed via a (wet-lab chemical protocol) for liquid specimens or b (dry-lab bioinformatics) for genomic data, explicitly banning mixed handling. Reasoning: Compliance software validates specimen type before queuing the job and rejects any attempt to schedule the alternate protocol, so a single specimen workflow can contain only one of the two.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Borderline loan applications first undergo a (automated scoring) and then proceed to b (manual credit-committee review) before a decision is issued. Reasoning: A single borderline application clearly contains the sequence a → b, so both activities occur together.\n2. For VIP travel bookings, the system performs a (automatic ticket issuance) while simultaneously dispatching b (manual travel-agent confirmation) as an extra layer of service. Reasoning: Each VIP booking spawns both automated and manual tasks, so a and b co-exist in the same booking workflow.\n3. When a customer changes address on an open order, support runs a (address verification) and then launches b (fraud re-check) within the same service call. Reasoning: The single service request explicitly chains a and b together.\n\nNotSuccession(a,b): b cannot occur after a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The customer-complaint workflow finishes with a (final client sign-off); when that step is saved the ticket auto-closes, making b (internal escalation) impossible afterwards. Reasoning: Activity a terminates the case, so no subsequent task—including b—can be executed.\n2. During checkout, b (fraud screening) is run before payment capture, and once a (payment capture) succeeds the order is locked from further screening. Reasoning: b is always completed earlier in the timeline; after a, the lock prevents any new b event.\n3. In emergency releases, committing a (force merge to main) marks CI job b (code linting) as ‘skipped’ and locks the pipeline. Reasoning: The status change blocks b from running after the merge.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Auditors record a (preliminary sign-off) and then launch b (final compliance audit) to complete the dossier. Reasoning: The workflow explicitly places b after a, proving the forbidden order can occur.\n2. The emergency-release pipeline performs a (force deploy) and only afterwards runs b (post-deploy regression tests). Reasoning: A single deployment run contains a first and b later, so b follows a.\n3. The warehouse seals pallets with a (shipment sealing) and later performs b (random quality-inspection pulls) before loading the truck. Reasoning: Quality inspections b are scheduled chronologically after pallet sealing a.\n\nRespondedExistence(a,b): If a occurs in the trace, then b occurs as well. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Any training session that records a (hands-on lab) must also show b (theory module) on the same attendance sheet. Reasoning: The attendance sheet is invalid without entries for both modules; thus a session containing a always contains b, with order left to the organizer.\n2. Every incident record that contains a (temporary workaround) is required by policy to include b (permanent resolution) in the same incident file. Reasoning: The data model treats the pair as mandatory fields on the same record; whichever is entered first, the other must exist before closure, so any trace with a inevitably contains b, but timing is flexible.\n3. If a sprint backlog includes a (security epic), governance checks confirm that b (pen-test task) is also on the board. Reasoning: Board validation happens at sprint start and end, ensuring both items co-appear even though teams pick their own ordering.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the quick-refund lane, an agent can execute a (issue refund) and close the ticket, while b (root-cause investigation) is marked ‘optional’ and often skipped. Reasoning: A legitimate trace exists where a is present and b never appears, contradicting the implication.\n2. For VIP travelers, the airline auto-issues a (boarding pass) but waives b (secondary identity check) unless a random audit flag is raised. Reasoning: Many VIP traces show a without the corresponding b event.\n3. A late-stage sales opportunity logs a (verbal commitment) immediately, while b (formal contract upload) may be omitted if the deal falls through. Reasoning: When a deal collapses, the trace holds a but never records b.\n\nFor each task, I provide the set of activity labels that exist in the process.\n\n\nThe list of activities used in this process are the following.

Only return a single valid JSON object exactly like this.**\n{\n  \"constraints\": [\n    {\n      \"template\": \"Response\",\n      \"parameters\": [[\"a\"], [\"b\"]]\n    },\n    {\n      \"template\": \"AtMost1\",\n      \"parameters\": [[\"c\"]]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nSupported Templates:\nConsider only the following declarative constraint definitions where a, b, c, and d are activities and template example-template(x,y) specifies a template named \"example-template\" and x and y can be one of the activities from the set of all activities. The supported declarative constraint templates in our framework are:\n- AtMost1(a)\n- AtLeast1(a)\n- Response(a, b)\n- Precedence(a, b)\n- CoExistence(a, b)\n- NotCoExistence(a, b)\n- NotSuccession(a, b)\n- RespondedExistence(a, b)\n** Only use these templates. Do not invent new ones or use logical operators like “or”. **\n\n\nSome more instructions:\nIt is not possible to generate constraints like Response(a, (b or c)). The first and second elements must be a single activity\nIf several valid constraints refer to the same activities, keep only the most restrictive one. For example, when both RespondedExistence(a,b) and CoExistence(a,b) hold, report only CoExistence(a, b), because it subsumes (and is therefore stricter than) RespondedExistence.\n\n\nInteraction Protocol\nWhen you receive a new input:\n1) You may write reasoning steps (internally) before producing the JSON object — but never include them in the output.\n2) Once confident, generate and return the JSON object containing the constraints.\n3) Do not include explanation or commentary in the output.\n\n\nSome examples to learn the constraints and reasoning better:\nAtMost1(a): a occurs at most once. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Activity a may appear only as the final step of the project. Reasoning: Because a project has exactly one last step, a cannot be repeated.\n2. Completing activity a requires a single-use safety clearance that can be issued only once per project. Reasoning: Once the unique clearance is consumed, a second a cannot obtain it, so no second occurrence is legal.\n3. The project terminates immediately once activity a has been executed. Reasoning: Ending the schedule right after a leaves no remaining time slots in which another a could happen.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. The maintenance routine begins with a, proceeds through b and c, and then repeats a before concluding with d. Reasoning: a appears both at the start and again before the end—two occurrences.\n2. Every four-hour production cycle executes the sequence a, b, c; the plant runs three such cycles per day. Reasoning: Each cycle contains an a, so the day’s schedule contains a three separate times.\n3. The curriculum covers unit a in week 1 and revisits unit a for advanced exercises in week 4. Reasoning: The same activity a is taught twice in the single course timeline.\n\n\nAtLeast1(a): a occurs at least once, which means the existance of activity a is mandatory. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every case begins with activity a for baseline approval before any other work may proceed. Reasoning: The word “begins” makes a the very first step of every project run, guaranteeing one occurrence.\n2. In each instance, teams must perform activity a to certify the data set’s integrity. Reasoning: Filing the report is part of the process, and a is declared a mandatory predecessor, so at least one a precedes filing.\n3. Any customer-service ticket is automatically routed to a (triage) before it can enter the resolution queue. Reasoning: Since tickets must pass through the queue to be resolved, each ticket necessarily triggers one execution of a.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. When an order arrives with a pre-approved credit flag, the workflow jumps straight to b for planning and never calls a. Reasoning: The conditional branch bypasses a entirely whenever the flag is present, so some executions contain zero a’s.\n2. During off-season maintenance, technicians may optionally perform a or proceed directly to c if no calibration is needed. Reasoning: Because a is labeled ‘optional,’ a valid path exists in which the technicians skip it.\n3. A legacy integration still routes certain tickets directly to c, bypassing a and b altogether. Reasoning: Tickets entering through the legacy path never encounter a, violating the mandatory-presence requirement.\n\n\nResponse(a,b): If a occurs, then b occurs after a.\nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Each new client request triggers a for intake, followed immediately by b for verification before any other tasks may start. Reasoning: a is hard-coded to be immediately succeeded by b; no branch exists between them, so every time a appears, b necessarily follows.\n2. In the onboarding pipeline, once a (collecting identity documents) completes, the workflow engine automatically schedules b (identity validation) as the very next step. Reasoning: The engine inserts b right after a without user discretion, eliminating any path where a occurs and b does not.\n3. For every premium order, a (fraud screening) is executed and, upon success, the system proceeds to b (payment capture) before shipping. Reasoning: The success path from a programmatically advances to b; orders cannot ship (the process goal) until b completes, so a ➔ b is enforced.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-checkout flow, the system executes a (payment capture) and ships the order immediately, skipping the fraud-review step b. Reasoning: A occurs, but b never happens, so the implication fails.\n2. During a critical-outage fix, engineers apply a (hot patch) and close the incident log without performing the normal post-patch verification b. Reasoning: The emergency path lets the process end with a but without a subsequent b.\n3. For VIP passengers, security screening b is completed pre-flight, and if an ID issue arises later, staff perform a secondary identity swipe a right at the gate. Reasoning: Here b occurs before a, not after it, breaking the required order.\n\n\nPrecedence(a,b): b occurs only if preceded by a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The manufacturing line enables b (packaging) only after a sensor logs a (final assembly complete). Reasoning: The control logic keeps the packaging station disabled until the assembly-complete flag from a is present, so every time b runs an earlier a must already have finished.\n2. Within the insurance-claims app, b (payout) can be triggered solely when the system finds a prior a (manager approval) entry for that claim. Reasoning: The trigger condition for b is the existence of an approval record; consequently, whenever b happens the claim’s history necessarily contains a preceding a. \n3. The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete. Reasoning: The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-refund path, an agent can execute b (instant payout) with a supervisor override even when a (fraud check) has not been run. Reasoning: The override permits b to happen in runs where a never took place, so b is not guaranteed to be preceded by a.\n2. During a critical-outage hot-fix, engineers deploy the patch (b) first and run the automated test suite (a) only afterward if time allows. Reasoning: Here b occurs before or even without a, breaking the ‘preceded-by’ requirement.\n3. In urgent onboarding, IT provisions the account (b) while HR finishes creating the employee record (a) the next day. Reasoning: The provisioning action b can occur one or more days before a, contradicting the rule.\n\n\nCoExistence(a,b): a and b occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every new support case triggers a (open-ticket record) and, in the same transaction, auto-creates b (initial customer-reply template). Reasoning: The system executes a composite routine that writes both database rows atomically, so whenever a is logged b is logged too, and neither appears alone.\n2. For each vendor purchase, the ERP posts a (goods-received note) and simultaneously posts b (accounts-payable accrual) in the same commit. Reasoning: Posting logic is wrapped in a single database transaction—if either insert fails the whole transaction rolls back—therefore the system state contains both or neither.\n3. Publishing a news article executes a (content push to CDN) and b (metadata push to search index) as a locked job pair—neither job can be run in isolation. Reasoning: The deploy orchestrator groups them under one job ID; a switch disables standalone execution, guaranteeing paired occurrence.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. For micro-refunds, the agent can execute b (instant payout) while the fraud-check a is skipped.

For VIP travel bookings, the system performs a (automatic ticket issuance) while simultaneously dispatching b (manual travel-agent confirmation) as an extra layer of service. Reasoning: Each VIP booking spawns both automated and manual tasks, so a and b co-exist in the same booking workflow.\n3. When a customer changes address on an open order, support runs a (address verification) and then launches b (fraud re-check) within the same service call. Reasoning: The single service request explicitly chains a and b together.\n\nNotSuccession(a,b): b cannot occur after a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The customer-complaint workflow finishes with a (final client sign-off); when that step is saved the ticket auto-closes, making b (internal escalation) impossible afterwards. Reasoning: Activity a terminates the case, so no subsequent task—including b—can be executed.\n2. During checkout, b (fraud screening) is run before payment capture, and once a (payment capture) succeeds the order is locked from further screening. Reasoning: b is always completed earlier in the timeline; after a, the lock prevents any new b event.\n3. In emergency releases, committing a (force merge to main) marks CI job b (code linting) as ‘skipped’ and locks the pipeline. Reasoning: The status change blocks b from running after the merge.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Auditors record a (preliminary sign-off) and then launch b (final compliance audit) to complete the dossier. Reasoning: The workflow explicitly places b after a, proving the forbidden order can occur.\n2. The emergency-release pipeline performs a (force deploy) and only afterwards runs b (post-deploy regression tests). Reasoning: A single deployment run contains a first and b later, so b follows a.\n3. The warehouse seals pallets with a (shipment sealing) and later performs b (random quality-inspection pulls) before loading the truck. Reasoning: Quality inspections b are scheduled chronologically after pallet sealing a.\n\nRespondedExistence(a,b): If a occurs in the trace, then b occurs as well. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Any training session that records a (hands-on lab) must also show b (theory module) on the same attendance sheet. Reasoning: The attendance sheet is invalid without entries for both modules; thus a session containing a always contains b, with order left to the organizer.\n2. Every incident record that contains a (temporary workaround) is required by policy to include b (permanent resolution) in the same incident file. Reasoning: The data model treats the pair as mandatory fields on the same record; whichever is entered first, the other must exist before closure, so any trace with a inevitably contains b, but timing is flexible.\n3. If a sprint backlog includes a (security epic), governance checks confirm that b (pen-test task) is also on the board. Reasoning: Board validation happens at sprint start and end, ensuring both items co-appear even though teams pick their own ordering.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the quick-refund lane, an agent can execute a (issue refund) and close the ticket, while b (root-cause investigation) is marked ‘optional’ and often skipped. Reasoning: A legitimate trace exists where a is present and b never appears, contradicting the implication.\n2. For VIP travelers, the airline auto-issues a (boarding pass) but waives b (secondary identity check) unless a random audit flag is raised. Reasoning: Many VIP traces show a without the corresponding b event.\n3. A late-stage sales opportunity logs a (verbal commitment) immediately, while b (formal contract upload) may be omitted if the deal falls through. Reasoning: When a deal collapses, the trace holds a but never records b.\n\nFor each task, I provide the set of activity labels that exist in the process.\n\n\nThe list of activities used in this process are the following. Please only use these activities to generate constraints:\nO_Accepted, A_Cancelled, A_Pending, A_Validating, O_Sent (online only), A_Denied, A_Accepted, O_Sent (mail and online), A_Complete, O_Create Offer, A_Incomplete, A_Submitted\n\nIt is not possible to have an application with both events: offer sent online and offer sent via mail and online.",

    "full_prompt": "Task Overview:\nYou are an assistant that helps translate free-text process descriptions into declarative process constraints.\n\nYour goal is to:\n1) Identify declarative constraints from the text.\n2) Return them in strict JSON format (see below).\n\nJSON Output Format:\nYou must always return a single valid JSON object in this format:\n** Do not return any explanation or markdown. Only return a single valid JSON object exactly like this.**\n{\n  \"constraints\": [\n    {\n      \"template\": \"Response\",\n      \"parameters\": [[\"a\"], [\"b\"]]\n    },\n    {\n      \"template\": \"AtMost1\",\n      \"parameters\": [[\"c\"]]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nSupported Templates:\nConsider only the following declarative constraint definitions where a, b, c, and d are activities and template example-template(x,y) specifies a template named \"example-template\" and x and y can be one of the activities from the set of all activities. The supported declarative constraint templates in our framework are:\n- AtMost1(a)\n- AtLeast1(a)\n- Response(a, b)\n- Precedence(a, b)\n- CoExistence(a, b)\n- NotCoExistence(a, b)\n- NotSuccession(a, b)\n- RespondedExistence(a, b)\n** Only use these templates. Do not invent new ones or use logical operators like “or”. **\n\n\nSome more instructions:\nIt is not possible to generate constraints like Response(a, (b or c)). The first and second elements must be a single activity\nIf several valid constraints refer to the same activities, keep only the most restrictive one. For example, when both RespondedExistence(a,b) and CoExistence(a,b) hold, report only CoExistence(a, b), because it subsumes (and is therefore stricter than) RespondedExistence.\n\n\nInteraction Protocol\nWhen you receive a new input:\n1) You may write reasoning steps (internally) before producing the JSON object — but never include them in the output.\n2) Once confident, generate and return the JSON object containing the constraints.\n3) Do not include explanation or commentary in the output.\n\n\nSome examples to learn the constraints and reasoning better:\nAtMost1(a): a occurs at most once. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Activity a may appear only as the final step of the project. Reasoning: Because a project has exactly one last step, a cannot be repeated.\n2. Completing activity a requires a single-use safety clearance that can be issued only once per project. Reasoning: Once the unique clearance is consumed, a second a cannot obtain it, so no second occurrence is legal.\n3. The project terminates immediately once activity a has been executed. Reasoning: Ending the schedule right after a leaves no remaining time slots in which another a could happen.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. The maintenance routine begins with a, proceeds through b and c, and then repeats a before concluding with d. Reasoning: a appears both at the start and again before the end—two occurrences.\n2. Every four-hour production cycle executes the sequence a, b, c; the plant runs three such cycles per day. Reasoning: Each cycle contains an a, so the day’s schedule contains a three separate times.\n3. The curriculum covers unit a in week 1 and revisits unit a for advanced exercises in week 4. Reasoning: The same activity a is taught twice in the single course timeline.\n\n\nAtLeast1(a): a occurs at least once, which means the existance of activity a is mandatory. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every case begins with activity a for baseline approval before any other work may proceed. Reasoning: The word “begins” makes a the very first step of every project run, guaranteeing one occurrence.\n2. In each instance, teams must perform activity a to certify the data set’s integrity. Reasoning: Filing the report is part of the process, and a is declared a mandatory predecessor, so at least one a precedes filing.\n3. Any customer-service ticket is automatically routed to a (triage) before it can enter the resolution queue. Reasoning: Since tickets must pass through the queue to be resolved, each ticket necessarily triggers one execution of a.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. When an order arrives with a pre-approved credit flag, the workflow jumps straight to b for planning and never calls a. Reasoning: The conditional branch bypasses a entirely whenever the flag is present, so some executions contain zero a’s.\n2. During off-season maintenance, technicians may optionally perform a or proceed directly to c if no calibration is needed. Reasoning: Because a is labeled ‘optional,’ a valid path exists in which the technicians skip it.\n3. A legacy integration still routes certain tickets directly to c, bypassing a and b altogether. Reasoning: Tickets entering through the legacy path never encounter a, violating the mandatory-presence requirement.\n\n\nResponse(a,b): If a occurs, then b occurs after a.\nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Each new client request triggers a for intake, followed immediately by b for verification before any other tasks may start. Reasoning: a is hard-coded to be immediately succeeded by b; no branch exists between them, so every time a appears, b necessarily follows.\n2. In the onboarding pipeline, once a (collecting identity documents) completes, the workflow engine automatically schedules b (identity validation) as the very next step. Reasoning: The engine inserts b right after a without user discretion, eliminating any path where a occurs and b does not.\n3. For every premium order, a (fraud screening) is executed and, upon success, the system proceeds to b (payment capture) before shipping. Reasoning: The success path from a programmatically advances to b; orders cannot ship (the process goal) until b completes, so a ➔ b is enforced.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-checkout flow, the system executes a (payment capture) and ships the order immediately, skipping the fraud-review step b. Reasoning: A occurs, but b never happens, so the implication fails.\n2. During a critical-outage fix, engineers apply a (hot patch) and close the incident log without performing the normal post-patch verification b. Reasoning: The emergency path lets the process end with a but without a subsequent b.\n3. For VIP passengers, security screening b is completed pre-flight, and if an ID issue arises later, staff perform a secondary identity swipe a right at the gate. Reasoning: Here b occurs before a, not after it, breaking the required order.\n\n\nPrecedence(a,b): b occurs only if preceded by a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The manufacturing line enables b (packaging) only after a sensor logs a (final assembly complete). Reasoning: The control logic keeps the packaging station disabled until the assembly-complete flag from a is present, so every time b runs an earlier a must already have finished.\n2. Within the insurance-claims app, b (payout) can be triggered solely when the system finds a prior a (manager approval) entry for that claim. Reasoning: The trigger condition for b is the existence of an approval record; consequently, whenever b happens the claim’s history necessarily contains a preceding a. \n3. The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete. Reasoning: The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-refund path, an agent can execute b (instant payout) with a supervisor override even when a (fraud check) has not been run. Reasoning: The override permits b to happen in runs where a never took place, so b is not guaranteed to be preceded by a.\n2. During a critical-outage hot-fix, engineers deploy the patch (b) first and run the automated test suite (a) only afterward if time allows. Reasoning: Here b occurs before or even without a, breaking the ‘preceded-by’ requirement.\n3. In urgent onboarding, IT provisions the account (b) while HR finishes creating the employee record (a) the next day. Reasoning: The provisioning action b can occur one or more days before a, contradicting the rule.\n\n\nCoExistence(a,b): a and b occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every new support case triggers a (open-ticket record) and, in the same transaction, auto-creates b (initial customer-reply template). Reasoning: The system executes a composite routine that writes both database rows atomically, so whenever a is logged b is logged too, and neither appears alone.\n2. For each vendor purchase, the ERP posts a (goods-received note) and simultaneously posts b (accounts-payable accrual) in the same commit. Reasoning: Posting logic is wrapped in a single database transaction—if either insert fails the whole transaction rolls back—therefore the system state contains both or neither.\n3. Publishing a news article executes a (content push to CDN) and b (metadata push to search index) as a locked job pair—neither job can be run in isolation. Reasoning: The deploy orchestrator groups them under one job ID; a switch disables standalone execution, guaranteeing paired occurrence.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. For micro-refunds, the agent can execute b (instant payout) while the fraud-check a is skipped. Reasoning: A valid path exists in which b occurs but a does not, so the pair does not always appear together.\n2. A legacy printer service fires b (shipping-label print) on address verification, but if inventory allocation a does not occur, the label still prints. Reasoning: The system can produce b even though a has not completed, so the two are not inseparable.\n3. When a student repeats a passed module, the registrar records a (module enrollment) but suppresses b (fee payment). Reasoning: This branch shows a without b, violating the rule.\n\n  \nNotCoExistence(a,b): a and b never occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. In the loan pipeline, low-risk applications flow through a (automatic approval) while high-risk ones are routed to b (manual committee review). Reasoning: The risk-based router selects exactly one mutually exclusive branch; a case flagged low-risk can never enter the high-risk branch and vice-versa, so no single run contains both a and b.\n2. At checkout a customer must choose either a (credit-card payment) or b (cash-on-delivery); the payment gateway disables the unselected option. Reasoning: The UI enforces a single-selection radio button and downstream code validates one—and only one—payment type, ensuring the two activities never co-appear in the same order.\n3. Regulations permit a sample to be processed via a (wet-lab chemical protocol) for liquid specimens or b (dry-lab bioinformatics) for genomic data, explicitly banning mixed handling. Reasoning: Compliance software validates specimen type before queuing the job and rejects any attempt to schedule the alternate protocol, so a single specimen workflow can contain only one of the two.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Borderline loan applications first undergo a (automated scoring) and then proceed to b (manual credit-committee review) before a decision is issued.

Reasoning: A single deployment run contains a first and b later, so b follows a.\n3. The warehouse seals pallets with a (shipment sealing) and later performs b (random quality-inspection pulls) before loading the truck. Reasoning: Quality inspections b are scheduled chronologically after pallet sealing a.\n\nRespondedExistence(a,b): If a occurs in the trace, then b occurs as well. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Any training session that records a (hands-on lab) must also show b (theory module) on the same attendance sheet. Reasoning: The attendance sheet is invalid without entries for both modules; thus a session containing a always contains b, with order left to the organizer.\n2. Every incident record that contains a (temporary workaround) is required by policy to include b (permanent resolution) in the same incident file. Reasoning: The data model treats the pair as mandatory fields on the same record; whichever is entered first, the other must exist before closure, so any trace with a inevitably contains b, but timing is flexible.\n3. If a sprint backlog includes a (security epic), governance checks confirm that b (pen-test task) is also on the board. Reasoning: Board validation happens at sprint start and end, ensuring both items co-appear even though teams pick their own ordering.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the quick-refund lane, an agent can execute a (issue refund) and close the ticket, while b (root-cause investigation) is marked ‘optional’ and often skipped. Reasoning: A legitimate trace exists where a is present and b never appears, contradicting the implication.\n2. For VIP travelers, the airline auto-issues a (boarding pass) but waives b (secondary identity check) unless a random audit flag is raised. Reasoning: Many VIP traces show a without the corresponding b event.\n3. A late-stage sales opportunity logs a (verbal commitment) immediately, while b (formal contract upload) may be omitted if the deal falls through.

Only return a single valid JSON object exactly like this.**\n{\n  \"constraints\": [\n    {\n      \"template\": \"Response\",\n      \"parameters\": [[\"a\"], [\"b\"]]\n    },\n    {\n      \"template\": \"AtMost1\",\n      \"parameters\": [[\"c\"]]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nSupported Templates:\nConsider only the following declarative constraint definitions where a, b, c, and d are activities and template example-template(x,y) specifies a template named \"example-template\" and x and y can be one of the activities from the set of all activities. The supported declarative constraint templates in our framework are:\n- AtMost1(a)\n- AtLeast1(a)\n- Response(a, b)\n- Precedence(a, b)\n- CoExistence(a, b)\n- NotCoExistence(a, b)\n- NotSuccession(a, b)\n- RespondedExistence(a, b)\n** Only use these templates. Do not invent new ones or use logical operators like “or”. **\n\n\nSome more instructions:\nIt is not possible to generate constraints like Response(a, (b or c)). The first and second elements must be a single activity\nIf several valid constraints refer to the same activities, keep only the most restrictive one. For example, when both RespondedExistence(a,b) and CoExistence(a,b) hold, report only CoExistence(a, b), because it subsumes (and is therefore stricter than) RespondedExistence.\n\n\nInteraction Protocol\nWhen you receive a new input:\n1) You may write reasoning steps (internally) before producing the JSON object — but never include them in the output.\n2) Once confident, generate and return the JSON object containing the constraints.\n3) Do not include explanation or commentary in the output.\n\n\nSome examples to learn the constraints and reasoning better:\nAtMost1(a): a occurs at most once. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Activity a may appear only as the final step of the project. Reasoning: Because a project has exactly one last step, a cannot be repeated.\n2. Completing activity a requires a single-use safety clearance that can be issued only once per project. Reasoning: Once the unique clearance is consumed, a second a cannot obtain it, so no second occurrence is legal.\n3. The project terminates immediately once activity a has been executed. Reasoning: Ending the schedule right after a leaves no remaining time slots in which another a could happen.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. The maintenance routine begins with a, proceeds through b and c, and then repeats a before concluding with d. Reasoning: a appears both at the start and again before the end—two occurrences.\n2. Every four-hour production cycle executes the sequence a, b, c; the plant runs three such cycles per day. Reasoning: Each cycle contains an a, so the day’s schedule contains a three separate times.\n3. The curriculum covers unit a in week 1 and revisits unit a for advanced exercises in week 4. Reasoning: The same activity a is taught twice in the single course timeline.\n\n\nAtLeast1(a): a occurs at least once, which means the existance of activity a is mandatory. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every case begins with activity a for baseline approval before any other work may proceed. Reasoning: The word “begins” makes a the very first step of every project run, guaranteeing one occurrence.\n2. In each instance, teams must perform activity a to certify the data set’s integrity. Reasoning: Filing the report is part of the process, and a is declared a mandatory predecessor, so at least one a precedes filing.\n3. Any customer-service ticket is automatically routed to a (triage) before it can enter the resolution queue. Reasoning: Since tickets must pass through the queue to be resolved, each ticket necessarily triggers one execution of a.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. When an order arrives with a pre-approved credit flag, the workflow jumps straight to b for planning and never calls a. Reasoning: The conditional branch bypasses a entirely whenever the flag is present, so some executions contain zero a’s.\n2. During off-season maintenance, technicians may optionally perform a or proceed directly to c if no calibration is needed. Reasoning: Because a is labeled ‘optional,’ a valid path exists in which the technicians skip it.\n3. A legacy integration still routes certain tickets directly to c, bypassing a and b altogether. Reasoning: Tickets entering through the legacy path never encounter a, violating the mandatory-presence requirement.\n\n\nResponse(a,b): If a occurs, then b occurs after a.\nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Each new client request triggers a for intake, followed immediately by b for verification before any other tasks may start. Reasoning: a is hard-coded to be immediately succeeded by b; no branch exists between them, so every time a appears, b necessarily follows.\n2. In the onboarding pipeline, once a (collecting identity documents) completes, the workflow engine automatically schedules b (identity validation) as the very next step. Reasoning: The engine inserts b right after a without user discretion, eliminating any path where a occurs and b does not.\n3. For every premium order, a (fraud screening) is executed and, upon success, the system proceeds to b (payment capture) before shipping. Reasoning: The success path from a programmatically advances to b; orders cannot ship (the process goal) until b completes, so a ➔ b is enforced.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-checkout flow, the system executes a (payment capture) and ships the order immediately, skipping the fraud-review step b. Reasoning: A occurs, but b never happens, so the implication fails.\n2. During a critical-outage fix, engineers apply a (hot patch) and close the incident log without performing the normal post-patch verification b. Reasoning: The emergency path lets the process end with a but without a subsequent b.\n3. For VIP passengers, security screening b is completed pre-flight, and if an ID issue arises later, staff perform a secondary identity swipe a right at the gate. Reasoning: Here b occurs before a, not after it, breaking the required order.\n\n\nPrecedence(a,b): b occurs only if preceded by a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The manufacturing line enables b (packaging) only after a sensor logs a (final assembly complete). Reasoning: The control logic keeps the packaging station disabled until the assembly-complete flag from a is present, so every time b runs an earlier a must already have finished.\n2. Within the insurance-claims app, b (payout) can be triggered solely when the system finds a prior a (manager approval) entry for that claim. Reasoning: The trigger condition for b is the existence of an approval record; consequently, whenever b happens the claim’s history necessarily contains a preceding a. \n3. The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete. Reasoning: The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-refund path, an agent can execute b (instant payout) with a supervisor override even when a (fraud check) has not been run. Reasoning: The override permits b to happen in runs where a never took place, so b is not guaranteed to be preceded by a.\n2. During a critical-outage hot-fix, engineers deploy the patch (b) first and run the automated test suite (a) only afterward if time allows. Reasoning: Here b occurs before or even without a, breaking the ‘preceded-by’ requirement.\n3. In urgent onboarding, IT provisions the account (b) while HR finishes creating the employee record (a) the next day. Reasoning: The provisioning action b can occur one or more days before a, contradicting the rule.\n\n\nCoExistence(a,b): a and b occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every new support case triggers a (open-ticket record) and, in the same transaction, auto-creates b (initial customer-reply template). Reasoning: The system executes a composite routine that writes both database rows atomically, so whenever a is logged b is logged too, and neither appears alone.\n2. For each vendor purchase, the ERP posts a (goods-received note) and simultaneously posts b (accounts-payable accrual) in the same commit. Reasoning: Posting logic is wrapped in a single database transaction—if either insert fails the whole transaction rolls back—therefore the system state contains both or neither.\n3. Publishing a news article executes a (content push to CDN) and b (metadata push to search index) as a locked job pair—neither job can be run in isolation. Reasoning: The deploy orchestrator groups them under one job ID; a switch disables standalone execution, guaranteeing paired occurrence.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. For micro-refunds, the agent can execute b (instant payout) while the fraud-check a is skipped. Reasoning: A valid path exists in which b occurs but a does not, so the pair does not always appear together.\n2. A legacy printer service fires b (shipping-label print) on address verification, but if inventory allocation a does not occur, the label still prints. Reasoning: The system can produce b even though a has not completed, so the two are not inseparable.\n3. When a student repeats a passed module, the registrar records a (module enrollment) but suppresses b (fee payment). Reasoning: This branch shows a without b, violating the rule.\n\n  \nNotCoExistence(a,b): a and b never occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. In the loan pipeline, low-risk applications flow through a (automatic approval) while high-risk ones are routed to b (manual committee review). Reasoning: The risk-based router selects exactly one mutually exclusive branch; a case flagged low-risk can never enter the high-risk branch and vice-versa, so no single run contains both a and b.\n2. At checkout a customer must choose either a (credit-card payment) or b (cash-on-delivery); the payment gateway disables the unselected option. Reasoning: The UI enforces a single-selection radio button and downstream code validates one—and only one—payment type, ensuring the two activities never co-appear in the same order.\n3. Regulations permit a sample to be processed via a (wet-lab chemical protocol) for liquid specimens or b (dry-lab bioinformatics) for genomic data, explicitly banning mixed handling. Reasoning: Compliance software validates specimen type before queuing the job and rejects any attempt to schedule the alternate protocol, so a single specimen workflow can contain only one of the two.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Borderline loan applications first undergo a (automated scoring) and then proceed to b (manual credit-committee review) before a decision is issued. Reasoning: A single borderline application clearly contains the sequence a → b, so both activities occur together.\n2. For VIP travel bookings, the system performs a (automatic ticket issuance) while simultaneously dispatching b (manual travel-agent confirmation) as an extra layer of service. Reasoning: Each VIP booking spawns both automated and manual tasks, so a and b co-exist in the same booking workflow.\n3. When a customer changes address on an open order, support runs a (address verification) and then launches b (fraud re-check) within the same service call. Reasoning: The single service request explicitly chains a and b together.\n\nNotSuccession(a,b): b cannot occur after a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The customer-complaint workflow finishes with a (final client sign-off); when that step is saved the ticket auto-closes, making b (internal escalation) impossible afterwards. Reasoning: Activity a terminates the case, so no subsequent task—including b—can be executed.\n2. During checkout, b (fraud screening) is run before payment capture, and once a (payment capture) succeeds the order is locked from further screening. Reasoning: b is always completed earlier in the timeline; after a, the lock prevents any new b event.\n3. In emergency releases, committing a (force merge to main) marks CI job b (code linting) as ‘skipped’ and locks the pipeline. Reasoning: The status change blocks b from running after the merge.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Auditors record a (preliminary sign-off) and then launch b (final compliance audit) to complete the dossier. Reasoning: The workflow explicitly places b after a, proving the forbidden order can occur.\n2. The emergency-release pipeline performs a (force deploy) and only afterwards runs b (post-deploy regression tests).

The supported declarative constraint templates in our framework are:\n- AtMost1(a)\n- AtLeast1(a)\n- Response(a, b)\n- Precedence(a, b)\n- CoExistence(a, b)\n- NotCoExistence(a, b)\n- NotSuccession(a, b)\n- RespondedExistence(a, b)\n** Only use these templates.

The first and second elements must be a single activity\nIf several valid constraints refer to the same activities, keep only the most restrictive one.

Activity a may appear only as the final step of the project. Reasoning: Because a project has exactly one last step, a cannot be repeated.\n2. Completing activity a requires a single-use safety clearance that can be issued only once per project. Reasoning: Once the unique clearance is consumed, a second a cannot obtain it, so no second occurrence is legal.\n3. The project terminates immediately once activity a has been executed. Reasoning: Ending the schedule right after a leaves no remaining time slots in which another a could happen.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. The maintenance routine begins with a, proceeds through b and c, and then repeats a before concluding with d. Reasoning: a appears both at the start and again before the end—two occurrences.\n2. Every four-hour production cycle executes the sequence a, b, c; the plant runs three such cycles per day. Reasoning: Each cycle contains an a, so the day’s schedule contains a three separate times.\n3. The curriculum covers unit a in week 1 and revisits unit a for advanced exercises in week 4. Reasoning: The same activity a is taught twice in the single course timeline.\n\n\nAtLeast1(a): a occurs at least once, which means the existance of activity a is mandatory. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every case begins with activity a for baseline approval before any other work may proceed. Reasoning: The word “begins” makes a the very first step of every project run, guaranteeing one occurrence.\n2. In each instance, teams must perform activity a to certify the data set’s integrity. Reasoning: Filing the report is part of the process, and a is declared a mandatory predecessor, so at least one a precedes filing.\n3. Any customer-service ticket is automatically routed to a (triage) before it can enter the resolution queue. Reasoning: Since tickets must pass through the queue to be resolved, each ticket necessarily triggers one execution of a.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. When an order arrives with a pre-approved credit flag, the workflow jumps straight to b for planning and never calls a. Reasoning: The conditional branch bypasses a entirely whenever the flag is present, so some executions contain zero a’s.\n2. During off-season maintenance, technicians may optionally perform a or proceed directly to c if no calibration is needed. Reasoning: Because a is labeled ‘optional,’ a valid path exists in which the technicians skip it.\n3. A legacy integration still routes certain tickets directly to c, bypassing a and b altogether. Reasoning: Tickets entering through the legacy path never encounter a, violating the mandatory-presence requirement.\n\n\nResponse(a,b): If a occurs, then b occurs after a.\nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Each new client request triggers a for intake, followed immediately by b for verification before any other tasks may start. Reasoning: a is hard-coded to be immediately succeeded by b; no branch exists between them, so every time a appears, b necessarily follows.\n2. In the onboarding pipeline, once a (collecting identity documents) completes, the workflow engine automatically schedules b (identity validation) as the very next step. Reasoning: The engine inserts b right after a without user discretion, eliminating any path where a occurs and b does not.\n3. For every premium order, a (fraud screening) is executed and, upon success, the system proceeds to b (payment capture) before shipping. Reasoning: The success path from a programmatically advances to b; orders cannot ship (the process goal) until b completes, so a ➔ b is enforced.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-checkout flow, the system executes a (payment capture) and ships the order immediately, skipping the fraud-review step b. Reasoning: A occurs, but b never happens, so the implication fails.\n2. During a critical-outage fix, engineers apply a (hot patch) and close the incident log without performing the normal post-patch verification b. Reasoning: The emergency path lets the process end with a but without a subsequent b.\n3. For VIP passengers, security screening b is completed pre-flight, and if an ID issue arises later, staff perform a secondary identity swipe a right at the gate. Reasoning: Here b occurs before a, not after it, breaking the required order.\n\n\nPrecedence(a,b): b occurs only if preceded by a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The manufacturing line enables b (packaging) only after a sensor logs a (final assembly complete). Reasoning: The control logic keeps the packaging station disabled until the assembly-complete flag from a is present, so every time b runs an earlier a must already have finished.\n2. Within the insurance-claims app, b (payout) can be triggered solely when the system finds a prior a (manager approval) entry for that claim. Reasoning: The trigger condition for b is the existence of an approval record; consequently, whenever b happens the claim’s history necessarily contains a preceding a. \n3. The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete. Reasoning: The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-refund path, an agent can execute b (instant payout) with a supervisor override even when a (fraud check) has not been run. Reasoning: The override permits b to happen in runs where a never took place, so b is not guaranteed to be preceded by a.\n2. During a critical-outage hot-fix, engineers deploy the patch (b) first and run the automated test suite (a) only afterward if time allows. Reasoning: Here b occurs before or even without a, breaking the ‘preceded-by’ requirement.\n3. In urgent onboarding, IT provisions the account (b) while HR finishes creating the employee record (a) the next day. Reasoning: The provisioning action b can occur one or more days before a, contradicting the rule.\n\n\nCoExistence(a,b): a and b occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every new support case triggers a (open-ticket record) and, in the same transaction, auto-creates b (initial customer-reply template). Reasoning: The system executes a composite routine that writes both database rows atomically, so whenever a is logged b is logged too, and neither appears alone.\n2. For each vendor purchase, the ERP posts a (goods-received note) and simultaneously posts b (accounts-payable accrual) in the same commit. Reasoning: Posting logic is wrapped in a single database transaction—if either insert fails the whole transaction rolls back—therefore the system state contains both or neither.\n3. Publishing a news article executes a (content push to CDN) and b (metadata push to search index) as a locked job pair—neither job can be run in isolation. Reasoning: The deploy orchestrator groups them under one job ID; a switch disables standalone execution, guaranteeing paired occurrence.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. For micro-refunds, the agent can execute b (instant payout) while the fraud-check a is skipped. Reasoning: A valid path exists in which b occurs but a does not, so the pair does not always appear together.\n2. A legacy printer service fires b (shipping-label print) on address verification, but if inventory allocation a does not occur, the label still prints. Reasoning: The system can produce b even though a has not completed, so the two are not inseparable.\n3. When a student repeats a passed module, the registrar records a (module enrollment) but suppresses b (fee payment). Reasoning: This branch shows a without b, violating the rule.\n\n  \nNotCoExistence(a,b): a and b never occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. In the loan pipeline, low-risk applications flow through a (automatic approval) while high-risk ones are routed to b (manual committee review). Reasoning: The risk-based router selects exactly one mutually exclusive branch; a case flagged low-risk can never enter the high-risk branch and vice-versa, so no single run contains both a and b.\n2. At checkout a customer must choose either a (credit-card payment) or b (cash-on-delivery); the payment gateway disables the unselected option. Reasoning: The UI enforces a single-selection radio button and downstream code validates one—and only one—payment type, ensuring the two activities never co-appear in the same order.\n3. Regulations permit a sample to be processed via a (wet-lab chemical protocol) for liquid specimens or b (dry-lab bioinformatics) for genomic data, explicitly banning mixed handling. Reasoning: Compliance software validates specimen type before queuing the job and rejects any attempt to schedule the alternate protocol, so a single specimen workflow can contain only one of the two.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Borderline loan applications first undergo a (automated scoring) and then proceed to b (manual credit-committee review) before a decision is issued. Reasoning: A single borderline application clearly contains the sequence a → b, so both activities occur together.\n2. For VIP travel bookings, the system performs a (automatic ticket issuance) while simultaneously dispatching b (manual travel-agent confirmation) as an extra layer of service. Reasoning: Each VIP booking spawns both automated and manual tasks, so a and b co-exist in the same booking workflow.\n3. When a customer changes address on an open order, support runs a (address verification) and then launches b (fraud re-check) within the same service call. Reasoning: The single service request explicitly chains a and b together.\n\nNotSuccession(a,b): b cannot occur after a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The customer-complaint workflow finishes with a (final client sign-off); when that step is saved the ticket auto-closes, making b (internal escalation) impossible afterwards. Reasoning: Activity a terminates the case, so no subsequent task—including b—can be executed.\n2. During checkout, b (fraud screening) is run before payment capture, and once a (payment capture) succeeds the order is locked from further screening. Reasoning: b is always completed earlier in the timeline; after a, the lock prevents any new b event.\n3. In emergency releases, committing a (force merge to main) marks CI job b (code linting) as ‘skipped’ and locks the pipeline. Reasoning: The status change blocks b from running after the merge.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Auditors record a (preliminary sign-off) and then launch b (final compliance audit) to complete the dossier. Reasoning: The workflow explicitly places b after a, proving the forbidden order can occur.\n2. The emergency-release pipeline performs a (force deploy) and only afterwards runs b (post-deploy regression tests). Reasoning: A single deployment run contains a first and b later, so b follows a.\n3. The warehouse seals pallets with a (shipment sealing) and later performs b (random quality-inspection pulls) before loading the truck. Reasoning: Quality inspections b are scheduled chronologically after pallet sealing a.\n\nRespondedExistence(a,b): If a occurs in the trace, then b occurs as well. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Any training session that records a (hands-on lab) must also show b (theory module) on the same attendance sheet. Reasoning: The attendance sheet is invalid without entries for both modules; thus a session containing a always contains b, with order left to the organizer.\n2. Every incident record that contains a (temporary workaround) is required by policy to include b (permanent resolution) in the same incident file. Reasoning: The data model treats the pair as mandatory fields on the same record; whichever is entered first, the other must exist before closure, so any trace with a inevitably contains b, but timing is flexible.\n3. If a sprint backlog includes a (security epic), governance checks confirm that b (pen-test task) is also on the board. Reasoning: Board validation happens at sprint start and end, ensuring both items co-appear even though teams pick their own ordering.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the quick-refund lane, an agent can execute a (issue refund) and close the ticket, while b (root-cause investigation) is marked ‘optional’ and often skipped. Reasoning: A legitimate trace exists where a is present and b never appears, contradicting the implication.\n2.

The first and second elements must be a single activity\nIf several valid constraints refer to the same activities, keep only the most restrictive one.

Activity a may appear only as the final step of the project. Reasoning: Because a project has exactly one last step, a cannot be repeated.\n2. Completing activity a requires a single-use safety clearance that can be issued only once per project. Reasoning: Once the unique clearance is consumed, a second a cannot obtain it, so no second occurrence is legal.\n3. The project terminates immediately once activity a has been executed. Reasoning: Ending the schedule right after a leaves no remaining time slots in which another a could happen.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. The maintenance routine begins with a, proceeds through b and c, and then repeats a before concluding with d. Reasoning: a appears both at the start and again before the end—two occurrences.\n2. Every four-hour production cycle executes the sequence a, b, c; the plant runs three such cycles per day. Reasoning: Each cycle contains an a, so the day’s schedule contains a three separate times.\n3. The curriculum covers unit a in week 1 and revisits unit a for advanced exercises in week 4. Reasoning: The same activity a is taught twice in the single course timeline.\n\n\nAtLeast1(a): a occurs at least once, which means the existance of activity a is mandatory. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every case begins with activity a for baseline approval before any other work may proceed. Reasoning: The word “begins” makes a the very first step of every project run, guaranteeing one occurrence.\n2. In each instance, teams must perform activity a to certify the data set’s integrity. Reasoning: Filing the report is part of the process, and a is declared a mandatory predecessor, so at least one a precedes filing.\n3. Any customer-service ticket is automatically routed to a (triage) before it can enter the resolution queue. Reasoning: Since tickets must pass through the queue to be resolved, each ticket necessarily triggers one execution of a.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. When an order arrives with a pre-approved credit flag, the workflow jumps straight to b for planning and never calls a. Reasoning: The conditional branch bypasses a entirely whenever the flag is present, so some executions contain zero a’s.\n2. During off-season maintenance, technicians may optionally perform a or proceed directly to c if no calibration is needed. Reasoning: Because a is labeled ‘optional,’ a valid path exists in which the technicians skip it.\n3. A legacy integration still routes certain tickets directly to c, bypassing a and b altogether. Reasoning: Tickets entering through the legacy path never encounter a, violating the mandatory-presence requirement.\n\n\nResponse(a,b): If a occurs, then b occurs after a.\nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Each new client request triggers a for intake, followed immediately by b for verification before any other tasks may start. Reasoning: a is hard-coded to be immediately succeeded by b; no branch exists between them, so every time a appears, b necessarily follows.\n2. In the onboarding pipeline, once a (collecting identity documents) completes, the workflow engine automatically schedules b (identity validation) as the very next step. Reasoning: The engine inserts b right after a without user discretion, eliminating any path where a occurs and b does not.\n3. For every premium order, a (fraud screening) is executed and, upon success, the system proceeds to b (payment capture) before shipping. Reasoning: The success path from a programmatically advances to b; orders cannot ship (the process goal) until b completes, so a ➔ b is enforced.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-checkout flow, the system executes a (payment capture) and ships the order immediately, skipping the fraud-review step b. Reasoning: A occurs, but b never happens, so the implication fails.\n2. During a critical-outage fix, engineers apply a (hot patch) and close the incident log without performing the normal post-patch verification b. Reasoning: The emergency path lets the process end with a but without a subsequent b.\n3. For VIP passengers, security screening b is completed pre-flight, and if an ID issue arises later, staff perform a secondary identity swipe a right at the gate. Reasoning: Here b occurs before a, not after it, breaking the required order.\n\n\nPrecedence(a,b): b occurs only if preceded by a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The manufacturing line enables b (packaging) only after a sensor logs a (final assembly complete). Reasoning: The control logic keeps the packaging station disabled until the assembly-complete flag from a is present, so every time b runs an earlier a must already have finished.\n2. Within the insurance-claims app, b (payout) can be triggered solely when the system finds a prior a (manager approval) entry for that claim. Reasoning: The trigger condition for b is the existence of an approval record; consequently, whenever b happens the claim’s history necessarily contains a preceding a. \n3. The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete. Reasoning: The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-refund path, an agent can execute b (instant payout) with a supervisor override even when a (fraud check) has not been run. Reasoning: The override permits b to happen in runs where a never took place, so b is not guaranteed to be preceded by a.\n2. During a critical-outage hot-fix, engineers deploy the patch (b) first and run the automated test suite (a) only afterward if time allows. Reasoning: Here b occurs before or even without a, breaking the ‘preceded-by’ requirement.\n3. In urgent onboarding, IT provisions the account (b) while HR finishes creating the employee record (a) the next day. Reasoning: The provisioning action b can occur one or more days before a, contradicting the rule.\n\n\nCoExistence(a,b): a and b occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every new support case triggers a (open-ticket record) and, in the same transaction, auto-creates b (initial customer-reply template). Reasoning: The system executes a composite routine that writes both database rows atomically, so whenever a is logged b is logged too, and neither appears alone.\n2. For each vendor purchase, the ERP posts a (goods-received note) and simultaneously posts b (accounts-payable accrual) in the same commit. Reasoning: Posting logic is wrapped in a single database transaction—if either insert fails the whole transaction rolls back—therefore the system state contains both or neither.\n3. Publishing a news article executes a (content push to CDN) and b (metadata push to search index) as a locked job pair—neither job can be run in isolation. Reasoning: The deploy orchestrator groups them under one job ID; a switch disables standalone execution, guaranteeing paired occurrence.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. For micro-refunds, the agent can execute b (instant payout) while the fraud-check a is skipped. Reasoning: A valid path exists in which b occurs but a does not, so the pair does not always appear together.\n2. A legacy printer service fires b (shipping-label print) on address verification, but if inventory allocation a does not occur, the label still prints. Reasoning: The system can produce b even though a has not completed, so the two are not inseparable.\n3. When a student repeats a passed module, the registrar records a (module enrollment) but suppresses b (fee payment). Reasoning: This branch shows a without b, violating the rule.\n\n  \nNotCoExistence(a,b): a and b never occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. In the loan pipeline, low-risk applications flow through a (automatic approval) while high-risk ones are routed to b (manual committee review). Reasoning: The risk-based router selects exactly one mutually exclusive branch; a case flagged low-risk can never enter the high-risk branch and vice-versa, so no single run contains both a and b.\n2. At checkout a customer must choose either a (credit-card payment) or b (cash-on-delivery); the payment gateway disables the unselected option. Reasoning: The UI enforces a single-selection radio button and downstream code validates one—and only one—payment type, ensuring the two activities never co-appear in the same order.\n3. Regulations permit a sample to be processed via a (wet-lab chemical protocol) for liquid specimens or b (dry-lab bioinformatics) for genomic data, explicitly banning mixed handling. Reasoning: Compliance software validates specimen type before queuing the job and rejects any attempt to schedule the alternate protocol, so a single specimen workflow can contain only one of the two.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Borderline loan applications first undergo a (automated scoring) and then proceed to b (manual credit-committee review) before a decision is issued. Reasoning: A single borderline application clearly contains the sequence a → b, so both activities occur together.\n2. For VIP travel bookings, the system performs a (automatic ticket issuance) while simultaneously dispatching b (manual travel-agent confirmation) as an extra layer of service. Reasoning: Each VIP booking spawns both automated and manual tasks, so a and b co-exist in the same booking workflow.\n3. When a customer changes address on an open order, support runs a (address verification) and then launches b (fraud re-check) within the same service call. Reasoning: The single service request explicitly chains a and b together.\n\nNotSuccession(a,b): b cannot occur after a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The customer-complaint workflow finishes with a (final client sign-off); when that step is saved the ticket auto-closes, making b (internal escalation) impossible afterwards. Reasoning: Activity a terminates the case, so no subsequent task—including b—can be executed.\n2. During checkout, b (fraud screening) is run before payment capture, and once a (payment capture) succeeds the order is locked from further screening. Reasoning: b is always completed earlier in the timeline; after a, the lock prevents any new b event.\n3. In emergency releases, committing a (force merge to main) marks CI job b (code linting) as ‘skipped’ and locks the pipeline. Reasoning: The status change blocks b from running after the merge.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Auditors record a (preliminary sign-off) and then launch b (final compliance audit) to complete the dossier. Reasoning: The workflow explicitly places b after a, proving the forbidden order can occur.\n2. The emergency-release pipeline performs a (force deploy) and only afterwards runs b (post-deploy regression tests). Reasoning: A single deployment run contains a first and b later, so b follows a.\n3. The warehouse seals pallets with a (shipment sealing) and later performs b (random quality-inspection pulls) before loading the truck. Reasoning: Quality inspections b are scheduled chronologically after pallet sealing a.\n\nRespondedExistence(a,b): If a occurs in the trace, then b occurs as well. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Any training session that records a (hands-on lab) must also show b (theory module) on the same attendance sheet. Reasoning: The attendance sheet is invalid without entries for both modules; thus a session containing a always contains b, with order left to the organizer.\n2. Every incident record that contains a (temporary workaround) is required by policy to include b (permanent resolution) in the same incident file. Reasoning: The data model treats the pair as mandatory fields on the same record; whichever is entered first, the other must exist before closure, so any trace with a inevitably contains b, but timing is flexible.\n3. If a sprint backlog includes a (security epic), governance checks confirm that b (pen-test task) is also on the board. Reasoning: Board validation happens at sprint start and end, ensuring both items co-appear even though teams pick their own ordering.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the quick-refund lane, an agent can execute a (issue refund) and close the ticket, while b (root-cause investigation) is marked ‘optional’ and often skipped. Reasoning: A legitimate trace exists where a is present and b never appears, contradicting the implication.\n2. For VIP travelers, the airline auto-issues a (boarding pass) but waives b (secondary identity check) unless a random audit flag is raised. Reasoning: Many VIP traces show a without the corresponding b event.\n3. A late-stage sales opportunity logs a (verbal commitment) immediately, while b (formal contract upload) may be omitted if the deal falls through. Reasoning: When a deal collapses, the trace holds a but never records b.\n\nFor each task, I provide the set of activity labels that exist in the process.\n\n\nThe list of activities used in this process are the following.

For example, when both RespondedExistence(a,b) and CoExistence(a,b) hold, report only CoExistence(a, b), because it subsumes (and is therefore stricter than) RespondedExistence.\n\n\nInteraction Protocol\nWhen you receive a new input:\n1) You may write reasoning steps (internally) before producing the JSON object — but never include them in the output.\n2) Once confident, generate and return the JSON object containing the constraints.\n3) Do not include explanation or commentary in the output.\n\n\nSome examples to learn the constraints and reasoning better:\nAtMost1(a): a occurs at most once. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Activity a may appear only as the final step of the project. Reasoning: Because a project has exactly one last step, a cannot be repeated.\n2. Completing activity a requires a single-use safety clearance that can be issued only once per project. Reasoning: Once the unique clearance is consumed, a second a cannot obtain it, so no second occurrence is legal.\n3. The project terminates immediately once activity a has been executed. Reasoning: Ending the schedule right after a leaves no remaining time slots in which another a could happen.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. The maintenance routine begins with a, proceeds through b and c, and then repeats a before concluding with d. Reasoning: a appears both at the start and again before the end—two occurrences.\n2. Every four-hour production cycle executes the sequence a, b, c; the plant runs three such cycles per day. Reasoning: Each cycle contains an a, so the day’s schedule contains a three separate times.\n3. The curriculum covers unit a in week 1 and revisits unit a for advanced exercises in week 4. Reasoning: The same activity a is taught twice in the single course timeline.\n\n\nAtLeast1(a): a occurs at least once, which means the existance of activity a is mandatory. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every case begins with activity a for baseline approval before any other work may proceed. Reasoning: The word “begins” makes a the very first step of every project run, guaranteeing one occurrence.\n2. In each instance, teams must perform activity a to certify the data set’s integrity. Reasoning: Filing the report is part of the process, and a is declared a mandatory predecessor, so at least one a precedes filing.\n3. Any customer-service ticket is automatically routed to a (triage) before it can enter the resolution queue. Reasoning: Since tickets must pass through the queue to be resolved, each ticket necessarily triggers one execution of a.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. When an order arrives with a pre-approved credit flag, the workflow jumps straight to b for planning and never calls a. Reasoning: The conditional branch bypasses a entirely whenever the flag is present, so some executions contain zero a’s.\n2. During off-season maintenance, technicians may optionally perform a or proceed directly to c if no calibration is needed. Reasoning: Because a is labeled ‘optional,’ a valid path exists in which the technicians skip it.\n3. A legacy integration still routes certain tickets directly to c, bypassing a and b altogether. Reasoning: Tickets entering through the legacy path never encounter a, violating the mandatory-presence requirement.\n\n\nResponse(a,b): If a occurs, then b occurs after a.\nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Each new client request triggers a for intake, followed immediately by b for verification before any other tasks may start. Reasoning: a is hard-coded to be immediately succeeded by b; no branch exists between them, so every time a appears, b necessarily follows.\n2. In the onboarding pipeline, once a (collecting identity documents) completes, the workflow engine automatically schedules b (identity validation) as the very next step. Reasoning: The engine inserts b right after a without user discretion, eliminating any path where a occurs and b does not.\n3. For every premium order, a (fraud screening) is executed and, upon success, the system proceeds to b (payment capture) before shipping. Reasoning: The success path from a programmatically advances to b; orders cannot ship (the process goal) until b completes, so a ➔ b is enforced.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-checkout flow, the system executes a (payment capture) and ships the order immediately, skipping the fraud-review step b. Reasoning: A occurs, but b never happens, so the implication fails.\n2. During a critical-outage fix, engineers apply a (hot patch) and close the incident log without performing the normal post-patch verification b. Reasoning: The emergency path lets the process end with a but without a subsequent b.\n3. For VIP passengers, security screening b is completed pre-flight, and if an ID issue arises later, staff perform a secondary identity swipe a right at the gate. Reasoning: Here b occurs before a, not after it, breaking the required order.\n\n\nPrecedence(a,b): b occurs only if preceded by a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The manufacturing line enables b (packaging) only after a sensor logs a (final assembly complete). Reasoning: The control logic keeps the packaging station disabled until the assembly-complete flag from a is present, so every time b runs an earlier a must already have finished.\n2. Within the insurance-claims app, b (payout) can be triggered solely when the system finds a prior a (manager approval) entry for that claim. Reasoning: The trigger condition for b is the existence of an approval record; consequently, whenever b happens the claim’s history necessarily contains a preceding a. \n3. The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete. Reasoning: The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-refund path, an agent can execute b (instant payout) with a supervisor override even when a (fraud check) has not been run. Reasoning: The override permits b to happen in runs where a never took place, so b is not guaranteed to be preceded by a.\n2. During a critical-outage hot-fix, engineers deploy the patch (b) first and run the automated test suite (a) only afterward if time allows. Reasoning: Here b occurs before or even without a, breaking the ‘preceded-by’ requirement.\n3. In urgent onboarding, IT provisions the account (b) while HR finishes creating the employee record (a) the next day. Reasoning: The provisioning action b can occur one or more days before a, contradicting the rule.\n\n\nCoExistence(a,b): a and b occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every new support case triggers a (open-ticket record) and, in the same transaction, auto-creates b (initial customer-reply template). Reasoning: The system executes a composite routine that writes both database rows atomically, so whenever a is logged b is logged too, and neither appears alone.\n2. For each vendor purchase, the ERP posts a (goods-received note) and simultaneously posts b (accounts-payable accrual) in the same commit. Reasoning: Posting logic is wrapped in a single database transaction—if either insert fails the whole transaction rolls back—therefore the system state contains both or neither.\n3. Publishing a news article executes a (content push to CDN) and b (metadata push to search index) as a locked job pair—neither job can be run in isolation. Reasoning: The deploy orchestrator groups them under one job ID; a switch disables standalone execution, guaranteeing paired occurrence.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. For micro-refunds, the agent can execute b (instant payout) while the fraud-check a is skipped. Reasoning: A valid path exists in which b occurs but a does not, so the pair does not always appear together.\n2. A legacy printer service fires b (shipping-label print) on address verification, but if inventory allocation a does not occur, the label still prints. Reasoning: The system can produce b even though a has not completed, so the two are not inseparable.\n3. When a student repeats a passed module, the registrar records a (module enrollment) but suppresses b (fee payment). Reasoning: This branch shows a without b, violating the rule.\n\n  \nNotCoExistence(a,b): a and b never occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. In the loan pipeline, low-risk applications flow through a (automatic approval) while high-risk ones are routed to b (manual committee review). Reasoning: The risk-based router selects exactly one mutually exclusive branch; a case flagged low-risk can never enter the high-risk branch and vice-versa, so no single run contains both a and b.\n2. At checkout a customer must choose either a (credit-card payment) or b (cash-on-delivery); the payment gateway disables the unselected option. Reasoning: The UI enforces a single-selection radio button and downstream code validates one—and only one—payment type, ensuring the two activities never co-appear in the same order.\n3. Regulations permit a sample to be processed via a (wet-lab chemical protocol) for liquid specimens or b (dry-lab bioinformatics) for genomic data, explicitly banning mixed handling. Reasoning: Compliance software validates specimen type before queuing the job and rejects any attempt to schedule the alternate protocol, so a single specimen workflow can contain only one of the two.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Borderline loan applications first undergo a (automated scoring) and then proceed to b (manual credit-committee review) before a decision is issued. Reasoning: A single borderline application clearly contains the sequence a → b, so both activities occur together.\n2. For VIP travel bookings, the system performs a (automatic ticket issuance) while simultaneously dispatching b (manual travel-agent confirmation) as an extra layer of service. Reasoning: Each VIP booking spawns both automated and manual tasks, so a and b co-exist in the same booking workflow.\n3. When a customer changes address on an open order, support runs a (address verification) and then launches b (fraud re-check) within the same service call. Reasoning: The single service request explicitly chains a and b together.\n\nNotSuccession(a,b): b cannot occur after a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The customer-complaint workflow finishes with a (final client sign-off); when that step is saved the ticket auto-closes, making b (internal escalation) impossible afterwards. Reasoning: Activity a terminates the case, so no subsequent task—including b—can be executed.\n2. During checkout, b (fraud screening) is run before payment capture, and once a (payment capture) succeeds the order is locked from further screening. Reasoning: b is always completed earlier in the timeline; after a, the lock prevents any new b event.\n3. In emergency releases, committing a (force merge to main) marks CI job b (code linting) as ‘skipped’ and locks the pipeline. Reasoning: The status change blocks b from running after the merge.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Auditors record a (preliminary sign-off) and then launch b (final compliance audit) to complete the dossier. Reasoning: The workflow explicitly places b after a, proving the forbidden order can occur.\n2. The emergency-release pipeline performs a (force deploy) and only afterwards runs b (post-deploy regression tests). Reasoning: A single deployment run contains a first and b later, so b follows a.\n3. The warehouse seals pallets with a (shipment sealing) and later performs b (random quality-inspection pulls) before loading the truck. Reasoning: Quality inspections b are scheduled chronologically after pallet sealing a.\n\nRespondedExistence(a,b): If a occurs in the trace, then b occurs as well. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Any training session that records a (hands-on lab) must also show b (theory module) on the same attendance sheet. Reasoning: The attendance sheet is invalid without entries for both modules; thus a session containing a always contains b, with order left to the organizer.\n2. Every incident record that contains a (temporary workaround) is required by policy to include b (permanent resolution) in the same incident file. Reasoning: The data model treats the pair as mandatory fields on the same record; whichever is entered first, the other must exist before closure, so any trace with a inevitably contains b, but timing is flexible.\n3. If a sprint backlog includes a (security epic), governance checks confirm that b (pen-test task) is also on the board. Reasoning: Board validation happens at sprint start and end, ensuring both items co-appear even though teams pick their own ordering.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the quick-refund lane, an agent can execute a (issue refund) and close the ticket, while b (root-cause investigation) is marked ‘optional’ and often skipped. Reasoning: A legitimate trace exists where a is present and b never appears, contradicting the implication.\n2. For VIP travelers, the airline auto-issues a (boarding pass) but waives b (secondary identity check) unless a random audit flag is raised. Reasoning: Many VIP traces show a without the corresponding b event.\n3. A late-stage sales opportunity logs a (verbal commitment) immediately, while b (formal contract upload) may be omitted if the deal falls through. Reasoning: When a deal collapses, the trace holds a but never records b.\n\nFor each task, I provide the set of activity labels that exist in the process.\n\n\nThe list of activities used in this process are the following.

Reasoning: Filing the report is part of the process, and a is declared a mandatory predecessor, so at least one a precedes filing.\n3. Any customer-service ticket is automatically routed to a (triage) before it can enter the resolution queue. Reasoning: Since tickets must pass through the queue to be resolved, each ticket necessarily triggers one execution of a.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. When an order arrives with a pre-approved credit flag, the workflow jumps straight to b for planning and never calls a. Reasoning: The conditional branch bypasses a entirely whenever the flag is present, so some executions contain zero a’s.\n2. During off-season maintenance, technicians may optionally perform a or proceed directly to c if no calibration is needed. Reasoning: Because a is labeled ‘optional,’ a valid path exists in which the technicians skip it.\n3. A legacy integration still routes certain tickets directly to c, bypassing a and b altogether. Reasoning: Tickets entering through the legacy path never encounter a, violating the mandatory-presence requirement.\n\n\nResponse(a,b): If a occurs, then b occurs after a.\nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Each new client request triggers a for intake, followed immediately by b for verification before any other tasks may start. Reasoning: a is hard-coded to be immediately succeeded by b; no branch exists between them, so every time a appears, b necessarily follows.\n2. In the onboarding pipeline, once a (collecting identity documents) completes, the workflow engine automatically schedules b (identity validation) as the very next step. Reasoning: The engine inserts b right after a without user discretion, eliminating any path where a occurs and b does not.\n3. For every premium order, a (fraud screening) is executed and, upon success, the system proceeds to b (payment capture) before shipping. Reasoning: The success path from a programmatically advances to b; orders cannot ship (the process goal) until b completes, so a ➔ b is enforced.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-checkout flow, the system executes a (payment capture) and ships the order immediately, skipping the fraud-review step b. Reasoning: A occurs, but b never happens, so the implication fails.\n2. During a critical-outage fix, engineers apply a (hot patch) and close the incident log without performing the normal post-patch verification b. Reasoning: The emergency path lets the process end with a but without a subsequent b.\n3. For VIP passengers, security screening b is completed pre-flight, and if an ID issue arises later, staff perform a secondary identity swipe a right at the gate. Reasoning: Here b occurs before a, not after it, breaking the required order.\n\n\nPrecedence(a,b): b occurs only if preceded by a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The manufacturing line enables b (packaging) only after a sensor logs a (final assembly complete). Reasoning: The control logic keeps the packaging station disabled until the assembly-complete flag from a is present, so every time b runs an earlier a must already have finished.\n2. Within the insurance-claims app, b (payout) can be triggered solely when the system finds a prior a (manager approval) entry for that claim. Reasoning: The trigger condition for b is the existence of an approval record; consequently, whenever b happens the claim’s history necessarily contains a preceding a. \n3. The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete. Reasoning: The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-refund path, an agent can execute b (instant payout) with a supervisor override even when a (fraud check) has not been run. Reasoning: The override permits b to happen in runs where a never took place, so b is not guaranteed to be preceded by a.\n2. During a critical-outage hot-fix, engineers deploy the patch (b) first and run the automated test suite (a) only afterward if time allows. Reasoning: Here b occurs before or even without a, breaking the ‘preceded-by’ requirement.\n3. In urgent onboarding, IT provisions the account (b) while HR finishes creating the employee record (a) the next day. Reasoning: The provisioning action b can occur one or more days before a, contradicting the rule.\n\n\nCoExistence(a,b): a and b occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every new support case triggers a (open-ticket record) and, in the same transaction, auto-creates b (initial customer-reply template). Reasoning: The system executes a composite routine that writes both database rows atomically, so whenever a is logged b is logged too, and neither appears alone.\n2. For each vendor purchase, the ERP posts a (goods-received note) and simultaneously posts b (accounts-payable accrual) in the same commit. Reasoning: Posting logic is wrapped in a single database transaction—if either insert fails the whole transaction rolls back—therefore the system state contains both or neither.\n3. Publishing a news article executes a (content push to CDN) and b (metadata push to search index) as a locked job pair—neither job can be run in isolation. Reasoning: The deploy orchestrator groups them under one job ID; a switch disables standalone execution, guaranteeing paired occurrence.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. For micro-refunds, the agent can execute b (instant payout) while the fraud-check a is skipped. Reasoning: A valid path exists in which b occurs but a does not, so the pair does not always appear together.\n2. A legacy printer service fires b (shipping-label print) on address verification, but if inventory allocation a does not occur, the label still prints. Reasoning: The system can produce b even though a has not completed, so the two are not inseparable.\n3. When a student repeats a passed module, the registrar records a (module enrollment) but suppresses b (fee payment). Reasoning: This branch shows a without b, violating the rule.\n\n  \nNotCoExistence(a,b): a and b never occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. In the loan pipeline, low-risk applications flow through a (automatic approval) while high-risk ones are routed to b (manual committee review). Reasoning: The risk-based router selects exactly one mutually exclusive branch; a case flagged low-risk can never enter the high-risk branch and vice-versa, so no single run contains both a and b.\n2. At checkout a customer must choose either a (credit-card payment) or b (cash-on-delivery); the payment gateway disables the unselected option. Reasoning: The UI enforces a single-selection radio button and downstream code validates one—and only one—payment type, ensuring the two activities never co-appear in the same order.\n3. Regulations permit a sample to be processed via a (wet-lab chemical protocol) for liquid specimens or b (dry-lab bioinformatics) for genomic data, explicitly banning mixed handling. Reasoning: Compliance software validates specimen type before queuing the job and rejects any attempt to schedule the alternate protocol, so a single specimen workflow can contain only one of the two.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Borderline loan applications first undergo a (automated scoring) and then proceed to b (manual credit-committee review) before a decision is issued. Reasoning: A single borderline application clearly contains the sequence a → b, so both activities occur together.\n2. For VIP travel bookings, the system performs a (automatic ticket issuance) while simultaneously dispatching b (manual travel-agent confirmation) as an extra layer of service. Reasoning: Each VIP booking spawns both automated and manual tasks, so a and b co-exist in the same booking workflow.\n3. When a customer changes address on an open order, support runs a (address verification) and then launches b (fraud re-check) within the same service call. Reasoning: The single service request explicitly chains a and b together.\n\nNotSuccession(a,b): b cannot occur after a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The customer-complaint workflow finishes with a (final client sign-off); when that step is saved the ticket auto-closes, making b (internal escalation) impossible afterwards. Reasoning: Activity a terminates the case, so no subsequent task—including b—can be executed.\n2. During checkout, b (fraud screening) is run before payment capture, and once a (payment capture) succeeds the order is locked from further screening. Reasoning: b is always completed earlier in the timeline; after a, the lock prevents any new b event.\n3. In emergency releases, committing a (force merge to main) marks CI job b (code linting) as ‘skipped’ and locks the pipeline. Reasoning: The status change blocks b from running after the merge.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Auditors record a (preliminary sign-off) and then launch b (final compliance audit) to complete the dossier. Reasoning: The workflow explicitly places b after a, proving the forbidden order can occur.\n2. The emergency-release pipeline performs a (force deploy) and only afterwards runs b (post-deploy regression tests). Reasoning: A single deployment run contains a first and b later, so b follows a.\n3. The warehouse seals pallets with a (shipment sealing) and later performs b (random quality-inspection pulls) before loading the truck. Reasoning: Quality inspections b are scheduled chronologically after pallet sealing a.\n\nRespondedExistence(a,b): If a occurs in the trace, then b occurs as well. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Any training session that records a (hands-on lab) must also show b (theory module) on the same attendance sheet. Reasoning: The attendance sheet is invalid without entries for both modules; thus a session containing a always contains b, with order left to the organizer.\n2. Every incident record that contains a (temporary workaround) is required by policy to include b (permanent resolution) in the same incident file. Reasoning: The data model treats the pair as mandatory fields on the same record; whichever is entered first, the other must exist before closure, so any trace with a inevitably contains b, but timing is flexible.\n3. If a sprint backlog includes a (security epic), governance checks confirm that b (pen-test task) is also on the board. Reasoning: Board validation happens at sprint start and end, ensuring both items co-appear even though teams pick their own ordering.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the quick-refund lane, an agent can execute a (issue refund) and close the ticket, while b (root-cause investigation) is marked ‘optional’ and often skipped. Reasoning: A legitimate trace exists where a is present and b never appears, contradicting the implication.\n2. For VIP travelers, the airline auto-issues a (boarding pass) but waives b (secondary identity check) unless a random audit flag is raised. Reasoning: Many VIP traces show a without the corresponding b event.\n3. A late-stage sales opportunity logs a (verbal commitment) immediately, while b (formal contract upload) may be omitted if the deal falls through. Reasoning: When a deal collapses, the trace holds a but never records b.\n\nFor each task, I provide the set of activity labels that exist in the process.\n\n\nThe list of activities used in this process are the following.

During a critical-outage fix, engineers apply a (hot patch) and close the incident log without performing the normal post-patch verification b. Reasoning: The emergency path lets the process end with a but without a subsequent b.\n3. For VIP passengers, security screening b is completed pre-flight, and if an ID issue arises later, staff perform a secondary identity swipe a right at the gate. Reasoning: Here b occurs before a, not after it, breaking the required order.\n\n\nPrecedence(a,b): b occurs only if preceded by a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The manufacturing line enables b (packaging) only after a sensor logs a (final assembly complete). Reasoning: The control logic keeps the packaging station disabled until the assembly-complete flag from a is present, so every time b runs an earlier a must already have finished.\n2. Within the insurance-claims app, b (payout) can be triggered solely when the system finds a prior a (manager approval) entry for that claim. Reasoning: The trigger condition for b is the existence of an approval record; consequently, whenever b happens the claim’s history necessarily contains a preceding a. \n3. The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete. Reasoning: The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-refund path, an agent can execute b (instant payout) with a supervisor override even when a (fraud check) has not been run. Reasoning: The override permits b to happen in runs where a never took place, so b is not guaranteed to be preceded by a.\n2. During a critical-outage hot-fix, engineers deploy the patch (b) first and run the automated test suite (a) only afterward if time allows. Reasoning: Here b occurs before or even without a, breaking the ‘preceded-by’ requirement.\n3. In urgent onboarding, IT provisions the account (b) while HR finishes creating the employee record (a) the next day. Reasoning: The provisioning action b can occur one or more days before a, contradicting the rule.\n\n\nCoExistence(a,b): a and b occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every new support case triggers a (open-ticket record) and, in the same transaction, auto-creates b (initial customer-reply template). Reasoning: The system executes a composite routine that writes both database rows atomically, so whenever a is logged b is logged too, and neither appears alone.\n2. For each vendor purchase, the ERP posts a (goods-received note) and simultaneously posts b (accounts-payable accrual) in the same commit. Reasoning: Posting logic is wrapped in a single database transaction—if either insert fails the whole transaction rolls back—therefore the system state contains both or neither.\n3. Publishing a news article executes a (content push to CDN) and b (metadata push to search index) as a locked job pair—neither job can be run in isolation. Reasoning: The deploy orchestrator groups them under one job ID; a switch disables standalone execution, guaranteeing paired occurrence.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. For micro-refunds, the agent can execute b (instant payout) while the fraud-check a is skipped. Reasoning: A valid path exists in which b occurs but a does not, so the pair does not always appear together.\n2. A legacy printer service fires b (shipping-label print) on address verification, but if inventory allocation a does not occur, the label still prints. Reasoning: The system can produce b even though a has not completed, so the two are not inseparable.\n3. When a student repeats a passed module, the registrar records a (module enrollment) but suppresses b (fee payment). Reasoning: This branch shows a without b, violating the rule.\n\n  \nNotCoExistence(a,b): a and b never occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. In the loan pipeline, low-risk applications flow through a (automatic approval) while high-risk ones are routed to b (manual committee review). Reasoning: The risk-based router selects exactly one mutually exclusive branch; a case flagged low-risk can never enter the high-risk branch and vice-versa, so no single run contains both a and b.\n2. At checkout a customer must choose either a (credit-card payment) or b (cash-on-delivery); the payment gateway disables the unselected option. Reasoning: The UI enforces a single-selection radio button and downstream code validates one—and only one—payment type, ensuring the two activities never co-appear in the same order.\n3. Regulations permit a sample to be processed via a (wet-lab chemical protocol) for liquid specimens or b (dry-lab bioinformatics) for genomic data, explicitly banning mixed handling. Reasoning: Compliance software validates specimen type before queuing the job and rejects any attempt to schedule the alternate protocol, so a single specimen workflow can contain only one of the two.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Borderline loan applications first undergo a (automated scoring) and then proceed to b (manual credit-committee review) before a decision is issued. Reasoning: A single borderline application clearly contains the sequence a → b, so both activities occur together.\n2. For VIP travel bookings, the system performs a (automatic ticket issuance) while simultaneously dispatching b (manual travel-agent confirmation) as an extra layer of service. Reasoning: Each VIP booking spawns both automated and manual tasks, so a and b co-exist in the same booking workflow.\n3. When a customer changes address on an open order, support runs a (address verification) and then launches b (fraud re-check) within the same service call. Reasoning: The single service request explicitly chains a and b together.\n\nNotSuccession(a,b): b cannot occur after a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The customer-complaint workflow finishes with a (final client sign-off); when that step is saved the ticket auto-closes, making b (internal escalation) impossible afterwards. Reasoning: Activity a terminates the case, so no subsequent task—including b—can be executed.\n2. During checkout, b (fraud screening) is run before payment capture, and once a (payment capture) succeeds the order is locked from further screening. Reasoning: b is always completed earlier in the timeline; after a, the lock prevents any new b event.\n3. In emergency releases, committing a (force merge to main) marks CI job b (code linting) as ‘skipped’ and locks the pipeline. Reasoning: The status change blocks b from running after the merge.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Auditors record a (preliminary sign-off) and then launch b (final compliance audit) to complete the dossier. Reasoning: The workflow explicitly places b after a, proving the forbidden order can occur.\n2. The emergency-release pipeline performs a (force deploy) and only afterwards runs b (post-deploy regression tests). Reasoning: A single deployment run contains a first and b later, so b follows a.\n3. The warehouse seals pallets with a (shipment sealing) and later performs b (random quality-inspection pulls) before loading the truck. Reasoning: Quality inspections b are scheduled chronologically after pallet sealing a.\n\nRespondedExistence(a,b): If a occurs in the trace, then b occurs as well. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Any training session that records a (hands-on lab) must also show b (theory module) on the same attendance sheet. Reasoning: The attendance sheet is invalid without entries for both modules; thus a session containing a always contains b, with order left to the organizer.\n2. Every incident record that contains a (temporary workaround) is required by policy to include b (permanent resolution) in the same incident file. Reasoning: The data model treats the pair as mandatory fields on the same record; whichever is entered first, the other must exist before closure, so any trace with a inevitably contains b, but timing is flexible.\n3. If a sprint backlog includes a (security epic), governance checks confirm that b (pen-test task) is also on the board. Reasoning: Board validation happens at sprint start and end, ensuring both items co-appear even though teams pick their own ordering.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the quick-refund lane, an agent can execute a (issue refund) and close the ticket, while b (root-cause investigation) is marked ‘optional’ and often skipped. Reasoning: A legitimate trace exists where a is present and b never appears, contradicting the implication.\n2. For VIP travelers, the airline auto-issues a (boarding pass) but waives b (secondary identity check) unless a random audit flag is raised. Reasoning: Many VIP traces show a without the corresponding b event.\n3. A late-stage sales opportunity logs a (verbal commitment) immediately, while b (formal contract upload) may be omitted if the deal falls through. Reasoning: When a deal collapses, the trace holds a but never records b.\n\nFor each task, I provide the set of activity labels that exist in the process.\n\n\nThe list of activities used in this process are the following.

Activity a may appear only as the final step of the project. Reasoning: Because a project has exactly one last step, a cannot be repeated.\n2. Completing activity a requires a single-use safety clearance that can be issued only once per project. Reasoning: Once the unique clearance is consumed, a second a cannot obtain it, so no second occurrence is legal.\n3. The project terminates immediately once activity a has been executed. Reasoning: Ending the schedule right after a leaves no remaining time slots in which another a could happen.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. The maintenance routine begins with a, proceeds through b and c, and then repeats a before concluding with d. Reasoning: a appears both at the start and again before the end—two occurrences.\n2. Every four-hour production cycle executes the sequence a, b, c; the plant runs three such cycles per day. Reasoning: Each cycle contains an a, so the day’s schedule contains a three separate times.\n3. The curriculum covers unit a in week 1 and revisits unit a for advanced exercises in week 4. Reasoning: The same activity a is taught twice in the single course timeline.\n\n\nAtLeast1(a): a occurs at least once, which means the existance of activity a is mandatory. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every case begins with activity a for baseline approval before any other work may proceed. Reasoning: The word “begins” makes a the very first step of every project run, guaranteeing one occurrence.\n2. In each instance, teams must perform activity a to certify the data set’s integrity. Reasoning: Filing the report is part of the process, and a is declared a mandatory predecessor, so at least one a precedes filing.\n3. Any customer-service ticket is automatically routed to a (triage) before it can enter the resolution queue. Reasoning: Since tickets must pass through the queue to be resolved, each ticket necessarily triggers one execution of a.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. When an order arrives with a pre-approved credit flag, the workflow jumps straight to b for planning and never calls a. Reasoning: The conditional branch bypasses a entirely whenever the flag is present, so some executions contain zero a’s.\n2. During off-season maintenance, technicians may optionally perform a or proceed directly to c if no calibration is needed. Reasoning: Because a is labeled ‘optional,’ a valid path exists in which the technicians skip it.\n3. A legacy integration still routes certain tickets directly to c, bypassing a and b altogether. Reasoning: Tickets entering through the legacy path never encounter a, violating the mandatory-presence requirement.\n\n\nResponse(a,b): If a occurs, then b occurs after a.\nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Each new client request triggers a for intake, followed immediately by b for verification before any other tasks may start. Reasoning: a is hard-coded to be immediately succeeded by b; no branch exists between them, so every time a appears, b necessarily follows.\n2. In the onboarding pipeline, once a (collecting identity documents) completes, the workflow engine automatically schedules b (identity validation) as the very next step. Reasoning: The engine inserts b right after a without user discretion, eliminating any path where a occurs and b does not.\n3. For every premium order, a (fraud screening) is executed and, upon success, the system proceeds to b (payment capture) before shipping. Reasoning: The success path from a programmatically advances to b; orders cannot ship (the process goal) until b completes, so a ➔ b is enforced.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1.

Reasoning: The provisioning action b can occur one or more days before a, contradicting the rule.\n\n\nCoExistence(a,b): a and b occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every new support case triggers a (open-ticket record) and, in the same transaction, auto-creates b (initial customer-reply template). Reasoning: The system executes a composite routine that writes both database rows atomically, so whenever a is logged b is logged too, and neither appears alone.\n2. For each vendor purchase, the ERP posts a (goods-received note) and simultaneously posts b (accounts-payable accrual) in the same commit. Reasoning: Posting logic is wrapped in a single database transaction—if either insert fails the whole transaction rolls back—therefore the system state contains both or neither.\n3. Publishing a news article executes a (content push to CDN) and b (metadata push to search index) as a locked job pair—neither job can be run in isolation. Reasoning: The deploy orchestrator groups them under one job ID; a switch disables standalone execution, guaranteeing paired occurrence.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. For micro-refunds, the agent can execute b (instant payout) while the fraud-check a is skipped. Reasoning: A valid path exists in which b occurs but a does not, so the pair does not always appear together.\n2. A legacy printer service fires b (shipping-label print) on address verification, but if inventory allocation a does not occur, the label still prints. Reasoning: The system can produce b even though a has not completed, so the two are not inseparable.\n3. When a student repeats a passed module, the registrar records a (module enrollment) but suppresses b (fee payment). Reasoning: This branch shows a without b, violating the rule.\n\n  \nNotCoExistence(a,b): a and b never occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. In the loan pipeline, low-risk applications flow through a (automatic approval) while high-risk ones are routed to b (manual committee review). Reasoning: The risk-based router selects exactly one mutually exclusive branch; a case flagged low-risk can never enter the high-risk branch and vice-versa, so no single run contains both a and b.\n2. At checkout a customer must choose either a (credit-card payment) or b (cash-on-delivery); the payment gateway disables the unselected option. Reasoning: The UI enforces a single-selection radio button and downstream code validates one—and only one—payment type, ensuring the two activities never co-appear in the same order.\n3. Regulations permit a sample to be processed via a (wet-lab chemical protocol) for liquid specimens or b (dry-lab bioinformatics) for genomic data, explicitly banning mixed handling. Reasoning: Compliance software validates specimen type before queuing the job and rejects any attempt to schedule the alternate protocol, so a single specimen workflow can contain only one of the two.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Borderline loan applications first undergo a (automated scoring) and then proceed to b (manual credit-committee review) before a decision is issued. Reasoning: A single borderline application clearly contains the sequence a → b, so both activities occur together.\n2. For VIP travel bookings, the system performs a (automatic ticket issuance) while simultaneously dispatching b (manual travel-agent confirmation) as an extra layer of service. Reasoning: Each VIP booking spawns both automated and manual tasks, so a and b co-exist in the same booking workflow.\n3. When a customer changes address on an open order, support runs a (address verification) and then launches b (fraud re-check) within the same service call. Reasoning: The single service request explicitly chains a and b together.\n\nNotSuccession(a,b): b cannot occur after a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The customer-complaint workflow finishes with a (final client sign-off); when that step is saved the ticket auto-closes, making b (internal escalation) impossible afterwards. Reasoning: Activity a terminates the case, so no subsequent task—including b—can be executed.\n2. During checkout, b (fraud screening) is run before payment capture, and once a (payment capture) succeeds the order is locked from further screening. Reasoning: b is always completed earlier in the timeline; after a, the lock prevents any new b event.\n3. In emergency releases, committing a (force merge to main) marks CI job b (code linting) as ‘skipped’ and locks the pipeline. Reasoning: The status change blocks b from running after the merge.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Auditors record a (preliminary sign-off) and then launch b (final compliance audit) to complete the dossier. Reasoning: The workflow explicitly places b after a, proving the forbidden order can occur.\n2. The emergency-release pipeline performs a (force deploy) and only afterwards runs b (post-deploy regression tests). Reasoning: A single deployment run contains a first and b later, so b follows a.\n3. The warehouse seals pallets with a (shipment sealing) and later performs b (random quality-inspection pulls) before loading the truck. Reasoning: Quality inspections b are scheduled chronologically after pallet sealing a.\n\nRespondedExistence(a,b): If a occurs in the trace, then b occurs as well. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Any training session that records a (hands-on lab) must also show b (theory module) on the same attendance sheet. Reasoning: The attendance sheet is invalid without entries for both modules; thus a session containing a always contains b, with order left to the organizer.\n2. Every incident record that contains a (temporary workaround) is required by policy to include b (permanent resolution) in the same incident file. Reasoning: The data model treats the pair as mandatory fields on the same record; whichever is entered first, the other must exist before closure, so any trace with a inevitably contains b, but timing is flexible.\n3. If a sprint backlog includes a (security epic), governance checks confirm that b (pen-test task) is also on the board. Reasoning: Board validation happens at sprint start and end, ensuring both items co-appear even though teams pick their own ordering.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the quick-refund lane, an agent can execute a (issue refund) and close the ticket, while b (root-cause investigation) is marked ‘optional’ and often skipped. Reasoning: A legitimate trace exists where a is present and b never appears, contradicting the implication.\n2. For VIP travelers, the airline auto-issues a (boarding pass) but waives b (secondary identity check) unless a random audit flag is raised. Reasoning: Many VIP traces show a without the corresponding b event.\n3. A late-stage sales opportunity logs a (verbal commitment) immediately, while b (formal contract upload) may be omitted if the deal falls through. Reasoning: When a deal collapses, the trace holds a but never records b.\n\nFor each task, I provide the set of activity labels that exist in the process.\n\n\nThe list of activities used in this process are the following. Please only use these activities to generate constraints:\nAccept Claim, Block Claim 3, Receive objection 1, Payment Order, Block Claim 2, Withdraw Claim, Execute Payment, Repayment, Block Claim 1, Correct Claim, Unblock Claim 3, Reject Claim, Receive Claim\n\nReceiving a claim is a mandatory step in the process.",

Only return a single valid JSON object exactly like this.**\n{\n  \"constraints\": [\n    {\n      \"template\": \"Response\",\n      \"parameters\": [[\"a\"], [\"b\"]]\n    },\n    {\n      \"template\": \"AtMost1\",\n      \"parameters\": [[\"c\"]]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nSupported Templates:\nConsider only the following declarative constraint definitions where a, b, c, and d are activities and template example-template(x,y) specifies a template named \"example-template\" and x and y can be one of the activities from the set of all activities. The supported declarative constraint templates in our framework are:\n- AtMost1(a)\n- AtLeast1(a)\n- Response(a, b)\n- Precedence(a, b)\n- CoExistence(a, b)\n- NotCoExistence(a, b)\n- NotSuccession(a, b)\n- RespondedExistence(a, b)\n** Only use these templates.

The first and second elements must be a single activity\nIf several valid constraints refer to the same activities, keep only the most restrictive one. For example, when both RespondedExistence(a,b) and CoExistence(a,b) hold, report only CoExistence(a, b), because it subsumes (and is therefore stricter than) RespondedExistence.\n\n\nInteraction Protocol\nWhen you receive a new input:\n1) You may write reasoning steps (internally) before producing the JSON object — but never include them in the output.\n2) Once confident, generate and return the JSON object containing the constraints.\n3) Do not include explanation or commentary in the output.\n\n\nSome examples to learn the constraints and reasoning better:\nAtMost1(a): a occurs at most once. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Activity a may appear only as the final step of the project. Reasoning: Because a project has exactly one last step, a cannot be repeated.\n2. Completing activity a requires a single-use safety clearance that can be issued only once per project. Reasoning: Once the unique clearance is consumed, a second a cannot obtain it, so no second occurrence is legal.\n3. The project terminates immediately once activity a has been executed. Reasoning: Ending the schedule right after a leaves no remaining time slots in which another a could happen.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. The maintenance routine begins with a, proceeds through b and c, and then repeats a before concluding with d. Reasoning: a appears both at the start and again before the end—two occurrences.\n2. Every four-hour production cycle executes the sequence a, b, c; the plant runs three such cycles per day. Reasoning: Each cycle contains an a, so the day’s schedule contains a three separate times.\n3. The curriculum covers unit a in week 1 and revisits unit a for advanced exercises in week 4. Reasoning: The same activity a is taught twice in the single course timeline.\n\n\nAtLeast1(a): a occurs at least once, which means the existance of activity a is mandatory. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every case begins with activity a for baseline approval before any other work may proceed. Reasoning: The word “begins” makes a the very first step of every project run, guaranteeing one occurrence.\n2. In each instance, teams must perform activity a to certify the data set’s integrity. Reasoning: Filing the report is part of the process, and a is declared a mandatory predecessor, so at least one a precedes filing.\n3. Any customer-service ticket is automatically routed to a (triage) before it can enter the resolution queue. Reasoning: Since tickets must pass through the queue to be resolved, each ticket necessarily triggers one execution of a.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. When an order arrives with a pre-approved credit flag, the workflow jumps straight to b for planning and never calls a. Reasoning: The conditional branch bypasses a entirely whenever the flag is present, so some executions contain zero a’s.\n2. During off-season maintenance, technicians may optionally perform a or proceed directly to c if no calibration is needed. Reasoning: Because a is labeled ‘optional,’ a valid path exists in which the technicians skip it.\n3. A legacy integration still routes certain tickets directly to c, bypassing a and b altogether. Reasoning: Tickets entering through the legacy path never encounter a, violating the mandatory-presence requirement.\n\n\nResponse(a,b): If a occurs, then b occurs after a.\nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Each new client request triggers a for intake, followed immediately by b for verification before any other tasks may start. Reasoning: a is hard-coded to be immediately succeeded by b; no branch exists between them, so every time a appears, b necessarily follows.\n2. In the onboarding pipeline, once a (collecting identity documents) completes, the workflow engine automatically schedules b (identity validation) as the very next step. Reasoning: The engine inserts b right after a without user discretion, eliminating any path where a occurs and b does not.\n3. For every premium order, a (fraud screening) is executed and, upon success, the system proceeds to b (payment capture) before shipping. Reasoning: The success path from a programmatically advances to b; orders cannot ship (the process goal) until b completes, so a ➔ b is enforced.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-checkout flow, the system executes a (payment capture) and ships the order immediately, skipping the fraud-review step b. Reasoning: A occurs, but b never happens, so the implication fails.\n2. During a critical-outage fix, engineers apply a (hot patch) and close the incident log without performing the normal post-patch verification b. Reasoning: The emergency path lets the process end with a but without a subsequent b.\n3. For VIP passengers, security screening b is completed pre-flight, and if an ID issue arises later, staff perform a secondary identity swipe a right at the gate. Reasoning: Here b occurs before a, not after it, breaking the required order.\n\n\nPrecedence(a,b): b occurs only if preceded by a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The manufacturing line enables b (packaging) only after a sensor logs a (final assembly complete). Reasoning: The control logic keeps the packaging station disabled until the assembly-complete flag from a is present, so every time b runs an earlier a must already have finished.\n2. Within the insurance-claims app, b (payout) can be triggered solely when the system finds a prior a (manager approval) entry for that claim. Reasoning: The trigger condition for b is the existence of an approval record; consequently, whenever b happens the claim’s history necessarily contains a preceding a. \n3. The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete. Reasoning: The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-refund path, an agent can execute b (instant payout) with a supervisor override even when a (fraud check) has not been run. Reasoning: The override permits b to happen in runs where a never took place, so b is not guaranteed to be preceded by a.\n2. During a critical-outage hot-fix, engineers deploy the patch (b) first and run the automated test suite (a) only afterward if time allows. Reasoning: Here b occurs before or even without a, breaking the ‘preceded-by’ requirement.\n3. In urgent onboarding, IT provisions the account (b) while HR finishes creating the employee record (a) the next day.

Reasoning: The UI enforces a single-selection radio button and downstream code validates one—and only one—payment type, ensuring the two activities never co-appear in the same order.\n3. Regulations permit a sample to be processed via a (wet-lab chemical protocol) for liquid specimens or b (dry-lab bioinformatics) for genomic data, explicitly banning mixed handling. Reasoning: Compliance software validates specimen type before queuing the job and rejects any attempt to schedule the alternate protocol, so a single specimen workflow can contain only one of the two.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Borderline loan applications first undergo a (automated scoring) and then proceed to b (manual credit-committee review) before a decision is issued. Reasoning: A single borderline application clearly contains the sequence a → b, so both activities occur together.\n2. For VIP travel bookings, the system performs a (automatic ticket issuance) while simultaneously dispatching b (manual travel-agent confirmation) as an extra layer of service. Reasoning: Each VIP booking spawns both automated and manual tasks, so a and b co-exist in the same booking workflow.\n3. When a customer changes address on an open order, support runs a (address verification) and then launches b (fraud re-check) within the same service call. Reasoning: The single service request explicitly chains a and b together.\n\nNotSuccession(a,b): b cannot occur after a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The customer-complaint workflow finishes with a (final client sign-off); when that step is saved the ticket auto-closes, making b (internal escalation) impossible afterwards. Reasoning: Activity a terminates the case, so no subsequent task—including b—can be executed.\n2. During checkout, b (fraud screening) is run before payment capture, and once a (payment capture) succeeds the order is locked from further screening. Reasoning: b is always completed earlier in the timeline; after a, the lock prevents any new b event.\n3. In emergency releases, committing a (force merge to main) marks CI job b (code linting) as ‘skipped’ and locks the pipeline. Reasoning: The status change blocks b from running after the merge.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Auditors record a (preliminary sign-off) and then launch b (final compliance audit) to complete the dossier. Reasoning: The workflow explicitly places b after a, proving the forbidden order can occur.\n2. The emergency-release pipeline performs a (force deploy) and only afterwards runs b (post-deploy regression tests). Reasoning: A single deployment run contains a first and b later, so b follows a.\n3. The warehouse seals pallets with a (shipment sealing) and later performs b (random quality-inspection pulls) before loading the truck. Reasoning: Quality inspections b are scheduled chronologically after pallet sealing a.\n\nRespondedExistence(a,b): If a occurs in the trace, then b occurs as well. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Any training session that records a (hands-on lab) must also show b (theory module) on the same attendance sheet. Reasoning: The attendance sheet is invalid without entries for both modules; thus a session containing a always contains b, with order left to the organizer.\n2. Every incident record that contains a (temporary workaround) is required by policy to include b (permanent resolution) in the same incident file. Reasoning: The data model treats the pair as mandatory fields on the same record; whichever is entered first, the other must exist before closure, so any trace with a inevitably contains b, but timing is flexible.\n3. If a sprint backlog includes a (security epic), governance checks confirm that b (pen-test task) is also on the board. Reasoning: Board validation happens at sprint start and end, ensuring both items co-appear even though teams pick their own ordering.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the quick-refund lane, an agent can execute a (issue refund) and close the ticket, while b (root-cause investigation) is marked ‘optional’ and often skipped. Reasoning: A legitimate trace exists where a is present and b never appears, contradicting the implication.\n2. For VIP travelers, the airline auto-issues a (boarding pass) but waives b (secondary identity check) unless a random audit flag is raised. Reasoning: Many VIP traces show a without the corresponding b event.\n3. A late-stage sales opportunity logs a (verbal commitment) immediately, while b (formal contract upload) may be omitted if the deal falls through. Reasoning: When a deal collapses, the trace holds a but never records b.\n\nFor each task, I provide the set of activity labels that exist in the process.\n\n\nThe list of activities used in this process are the following.

Only return a single valid JSON object exactly like this.**\n{\n  \"constraints\": [\n    {\n      \"template\": \"Response\",\n      \"parameters\": [[\"a\"], [\"b\"]]\n    },\n    {\n      \"template\": \"AtMost1\",\n      \"parameters\": [[\"c\"]]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nSupported Templates:\nConsider only the following declarative constraint definitions where a, b, c, and d are activities and template example-template(x,y) specifies a template named \"example-template\" and x and y can be one of the activities from the set of all activities. The supported declarative constraint templates in our framework are:\n- AtMost1(a)\n- AtLeast1(a)\n- Response(a, b)\n- Precedence(a, b)\n- CoExistence(a, b)\n- NotCoExistence(a, b)\n- NotSuccession(a, b)\n- RespondedExistence(a, b)\n** Only use these templates. Do not invent new ones or use logical operators like “or”. **\n\n\nSome more instructions:\nIt is not possible to generate constraints like Response(a, (b or c)). The first and second elements must be a single activity\nIf several valid constraints refer to the same activities, keep only the most restrictive one. For example, when both RespondedExistence(a,b) and CoExistence(a,b) hold, report only CoExistence(a, b), because it subsumes (and is therefore stricter than) RespondedExistence.\n\n\nInteraction Protocol\nWhen you receive a new input:\n1) You may write reasoning steps (internally) before producing the JSON object — but never include them in the output.\n2) Once confident, generate and return the JSON object containing the constraints.\n3) Do not include explanation or commentary in the output.\n\n\nSome examples to learn the constraints and reasoning better:\nAtMost1(a): a occurs at most once. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Activity a may appear only as the final step of the project. Reasoning: Because a project has exactly one last step, a cannot be repeated.\n2. Completing activity a requires a single-use safety clearance that can be issued only once per project. Reasoning: Once the unique clearance is consumed, a second a cannot obtain it, so no second occurrence is legal.\n3. The project terminates immediately once activity a has been executed. Reasoning: Ending the schedule right after a leaves no remaining time slots in which another a could happen.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. The maintenance routine begins with a, proceeds through b and c, and then repeats a before concluding with d. Reasoning: a appears both at the start and again before the end—two occurrences.\n2. Every four-hour production cycle executes the sequence a, b, c; the plant runs three such cycles per day. Reasoning: Each cycle contains an a, so the day’s schedule contains a three separate times.\n3. The curriculum covers unit a in week 1 and revisits unit a for advanced exercises in week 4. Reasoning: The same activity a is taught twice in the single course timeline.\n\n\nAtLeast1(a): a occurs at least once, which means the existance of activity a is mandatory. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every case begins with activity a for baseline approval before any other work may proceed. Reasoning: The word “begins” makes a the very first step of every project run, guaranteeing one occurrence.\n2. In each instance, teams must perform activity a to certify the data set’s integrity. Reasoning: Filing the report is part of the process, and a is declared a mandatory predecessor, so at least one a precedes filing.\n3. Any customer-service ticket is automatically routed to a (triage) before it can enter the resolution queue. Reasoning: Since tickets must pass through the queue to be resolved, each ticket necessarily triggers one execution of a.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. When an order arrives with a pre-approved credit flag, the workflow jumps straight to b for planning and never calls a. Reasoning: The conditional branch bypasses a entirely whenever the flag is present, so some executions contain zero a’s.\n2. During off-season maintenance, technicians may optionally perform a or proceed directly to c if no calibration is needed. Reasoning: Because a is labeled ‘optional,’ a valid path exists in which the technicians skip it.\n3. A legacy integration still routes certain tickets directly to c, bypassing a and b altogether. Reasoning: Tickets entering through the legacy path never encounter a, violating the mandatory-presence requirement.\n\n\nResponse(a,b): If a occurs, then b occurs after a.\nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Each new client request triggers a for intake, followed immediately by b for verification before any other tasks may start. Reasoning: a is hard-coded to be immediately succeeded by b; no branch exists between them, so every time a appears, b necessarily follows.\n2. In the onboarding pipeline, once a (collecting identity documents) completes, the workflow engine automatically schedules b (identity validation) as the very next step. Reasoning: The engine inserts b right after a without user discretion, eliminating any path where a occurs and b does not.\n3. For every premium order, a (fraud screening) is executed and, upon success, the system proceeds to b (payment capture) before shipping. Reasoning: The success path from a programmatically advances to b; orders cannot ship (the process goal) until b completes, so a ➔ b is enforced.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-checkout flow, the system executes a (payment capture) and ships the order immediately, skipping the fraud-review step b. Reasoning: A occurs, but b never happens, so the implication fails.\n2. During a critical-outage fix, engineers apply a (hot patch) and close the incident log without performing the normal post-patch verification b. Reasoning: The emergency path lets the process end with a but without a subsequent b.\n3. For VIP passengers, security screening b is completed pre-flight, and if an ID issue arises later, staff perform a secondary identity swipe a right at the gate. Reasoning: Here b occurs before a, not after it, breaking the required order.\n\n\nPrecedence(a,b): b occurs only if preceded by a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The manufacturing line enables b (packaging) only after a sensor logs a (final assembly complete). Reasoning: The control logic keeps the packaging station disabled until the assembly-complete flag from a is present, so every time b runs an earlier a must already have finished.\n2. Within the insurance-claims app, b (payout) can be triggered solely when the system finds a prior a (manager approval) entry for that claim. Reasoning: The trigger condition for b is the existence of an approval record; consequently, whenever b happens the claim’s history necessarily contains a preceding a. \n3. The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete. Reasoning: The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-refund path, an agent can execute b (instant payout) with a supervisor override even when a (fraud check) has not been run. Reasoning: The override permits b to happen in runs where a never took place, so b is not guaranteed to be preceded by a.\n2. During a critical-outage hot-fix, engineers deploy the patch (b) first and run the automated test suite (a) only afterward if time allows. Reasoning: Here b occurs before or even without a, breaking the ‘preceded-by’ requirement.\n3. In urgent onboarding, IT provisions the account (b) while HR finishes creating the employee record (a) the next day. Reasoning: The provisioning action b can occur one or more days before a, contradicting the rule.\n\n\nCoExistence(a,b): a and b occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every new support case triggers a (open-ticket record) and, in the same transaction, auto-creates b (initial customer-reply template). Reasoning: The system executes a composite routine that writes both database rows atomically, so whenever a is logged b is logged too, and neither appears alone.\n2. For each vendor purchase, the ERP posts a (goods-received note) and simultaneously posts b (accounts-payable accrual) in the same commit. Reasoning: Posting logic is wrapped in a single database transaction—if either insert fails the whole transaction rolls back—therefore the system state contains both or neither.\n3. Publishing a news article executes a (content push to CDN) and b (metadata push to search index) as a locked job pair—neither job can be run in isolation. Reasoning: The deploy orchestrator groups them under one job ID; a switch disables standalone execution, guaranteeing paired occurrence.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. For micro-refunds, the agent can execute b (instant payout) while the fraud-check a is skipped. Reasoning: A valid path exists in which b occurs but a does not, so the pair does not always appear together.\n2. A legacy printer service fires b (shipping-label print) on address verification, but if inventory allocation a does not occur, the label still prints. Reasoning: The system can produce b even though a has not completed, so the two are not inseparable.\n3. When a student repeats a passed module, the registrar records a (module enrollment) but suppresses b (fee payment). Reasoning: This branch shows a without b, violating the rule.\n\n  \nNotCoExistence(a,b): a and b never occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. In the loan pipeline, low-risk applications flow through a (automatic approval) while high-risk ones are routed to b (manual committee review).

During checkout, b (fraud screening) is run before payment capture, and once a (payment capture) succeeds the order is locked from further screening. Reasoning: b is always completed earlier in the timeline; after a, the lock prevents any new b event.\n3. In emergency releases, committing a (force merge to main) marks CI job b (code linting) as ‘skipped’ and locks the pipeline. Reasoning: The status change blocks b from running after the merge.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Auditors record a (preliminary sign-off) and then launch b (final compliance audit) to complete the dossier. Reasoning: The workflow explicitly places b after a, proving the forbidden order can occur.\n2. The emergency-release pipeline performs a (force deploy) and only afterwards runs b (post-deploy regression tests). Reasoning: A single deployment run contains a first and b later, so b follows a.\n3. The warehouse seals pallets with a (shipment sealing) and later performs b (random quality-inspection pulls) before loading the truck. Reasoning: Quality inspections b are scheduled chronologically after pallet sealing a.\n\nRespondedExistence(a,b): If a occurs in the trace, then b occurs as well. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Any training session that records a (hands-on lab) must also show b (theory module) on the same attendance sheet. Reasoning: The attendance sheet is invalid without entries for both modules; thus a session containing a always contains b, with order left to the organizer.\n2. Every incident record that contains a (temporary workaround) is required by policy to include b (permanent resolution) in the same incident file. Reasoning: The data model treats the pair as mandatory fields on the same record; whichever is entered first, the other must exist before closure, so any trace with a inevitably contains b, but timing is flexible.\n3. If a sprint backlog includes a (security epic), governance checks confirm that b (pen-test task) is also on the board. Reasoning: Board validation happens at sprint start and end, ensuring both items co-appear even though teams pick their own ordering.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the quick-refund lane, an agent can execute a (issue refund) and close the ticket, while b (root-cause investigation) is marked ‘optional’ and often skipped. Reasoning: A legitimate trace exists where a is present and b never appears, contradicting the implication.\n2. For VIP travelers, the airline auto-issues a (boarding pass) but waives b (secondary identity check) unless a random audit flag is raised. Reasoning: Many VIP traces show a without the corresponding b event.\n3. A late-stage sales opportunity logs a (verbal commitment) immediately, while b (formal contract upload) may be omitted if the deal falls through. Reasoning: When a deal collapses, the trace holds a but never records b.\n\nFor each task, I provide the set of activity labels that exist in the process.\n\n\nThe list of activities used in this process are the following.

Only return a single valid JSON object exactly like this.**\n{\n  \"constraints\": [\n    {\n      \"template\": \"Response\",\n      \"parameters\": [[\"a\"], [\"b\"]]\n    },\n    {\n      \"template\": \"AtMost1\",\n      \"parameters\": [[\"c\"]]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nSupported Templates:\nConsider only the following declarative constraint definitions where a, b, c, and d are activities and template example-template(x,y) specifies a template named \"example-template\" and x and y can be one of the activities from the set of all activities. The supported declarative constraint templates in our framework are:\n- AtMost1(a)\n- AtLeast1(a)\n- Response(a, b)\n- Precedence(a, b)\n- CoExistence(a, b)\n- NotCoExistence(a, b)\n- NotSuccession(a, b)\n- RespondedExistence(a, b)\n** Only use these templates. Do not invent new ones or use logical operators like “or”. **\n\n\nSome more instructions:\nIt is not possible to generate constraints like Response(a, (b or c)). The first and second elements must be a single activity\nIf several valid constraints refer to the same activities, keep only the most restrictive one. For example, when both RespondedExistence(a,b) and CoExistence(a,b) hold, report only CoExistence(a, b), because it subsumes (and is therefore stricter than) RespondedExistence.\n\n\nInteraction Protocol\nWhen you receive a new input:\n1) You may write reasoning steps (internally) before producing the JSON object — but never include them in the output.\n2) Once confident, generate and return the JSON object containing the constraints.\n3) Do not include explanation or commentary in the output.\n\n\nSome examples to learn the constraints and reasoning better:\nAtMost1(a): a occurs at most once. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Activity a may appear only as the final step of the project. Reasoning: Because a project has exactly one last step, a cannot be repeated.\n2. Completing activity a requires a single-use safety clearance that can be issued only once per project. Reasoning: Once the unique clearance is consumed, a second a cannot obtain it, so no second occurrence is legal.\n3. The project terminates immediately once activity a has been executed. Reasoning: Ending the schedule right after a leaves no remaining time slots in which another a could happen.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. The maintenance routine begins with a, proceeds through b and c, and then repeats a before concluding with d. Reasoning: a appears both at the start and again before the end—two occurrences.\n2. Every four-hour production cycle executes the sequence a, b, c; the plant runs three such cycles per day. Reasoning: Each cycle contains an a, so the day’s schedule contains a three separate times.\n3. The curriculum covers unit a in week 1 and revisits unit a for advanced exercises in week 4. Reasoning: The same activity a is taught twice in the single course timeline.\n\n\nAtLeast1(a): a occurs at least once, which means the existance of activity a is mandatory. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every case begins with activity a for baseline approval before any other work may proceed. Reasoning: The word “begins” makes a the very first step of every project run, guaranteeing one occurrence.\n2. In each instance, teams must perform activity a to certify the data set’s integrity. Reasoning: Filing the report is part of the process, and a is declared a mandatory predecessor, so at least one a precedes filing.\n3. Any customer-service ticket is automatically routed to a (triage) before it can enter the resolution queue. Reasoning: Since tickets must pass through the queue to be resolved, each ticket necessarily triggers one execution of a.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. When an order arrives with a pre-approved credit flag, the workflow jumps straight to b for planning and never calls a. Reasoning: The conditional branch bypasses a entirely whenever the flag is present, so some executions contain zero a’s.\n2. During off-season maintenance, technicians may optionally perform a or proceed directly to c if no calibration is needed. Reasoning: Because a is labeled ‘optional,’ a valid path exists in which the technicians skip it.\n3. A legacy integration still routes certain tickets directly to c, bypassing a and b altogether. Reasoning: Tickets entering through the legacy path never encounter a, violating the mandatory-presence requirement.\n\n\nResponse(a,b): If a occurs, then b occurs after a.\nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Each new client request triggers a for intake, followed immediately by b for verification before any other tasks may start. Reasoning: a is hard-coded to be immediately succeeded by b; no branch exists between them, so every time a appears, b necessarily follows.\n2. In the onboarding pipeline, once a (collecting identity documents) completes, the workflow engine automatically schedules b (identity validation) as the very next step. Reasoning: The engine inserts b right after a without user discretion, eliminating any path where a occurs and b does not.\n3. For every premium order, a (fraud screening) is executed and, upon success, the system proceeds to b (payment capture) before shipping. Reasoning: The success path from a programmatically advances to b; orders cannot ship (the process goal) until b completes, so a ➔ b is enforced.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-checkout flow, the system executes a (payment capture) and ships the order immediately, skipping the fraud-review step b. Reasoning: A occurs, but b never happens, so the implication fails.\n2. During a critical-outage fix, engineers apply a (hot patch) and close the incident log without performing the normal post-patch verification b. Reasoning: The emergency path lets the process end with a but without a subsequent b.\n3. For VIP passengers, security screening b is completed pre-flight, and if an ID issue arises later, staff perform a secondary identity swipe a right at the gate. Reasoning: Here b occurs before a, not after it, breaking the required order.\n\n\nPrecedence(a,b): b occurs only if preceded by a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The manufacturing line enables b (packaging) only after a sensor logs a (final assembly complete). Reasoning: The control logic keeps the packaging station disabled until the assembly-complete flag from a is present, so every time b runs an earlier a must already have finished.\n2. Within the insurance-claims app, b (payout) can be triggered solely when the system finds a prior a (manager approval) entry for that claim. Reasoning: The trigger condition for b is the existence of an approval record; consequently, whenever b happens the claim’s history necessarily contains a preceding a. \n3. The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete. Reasoning: The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-refund path, an agent can execute b (instant payout) with a supervisor override even when a (fraud check) has not been run. Reasoning: The override permits b to happen in runs where a never took place, so b is not guaranteed to be preceded by a.\n2. During a critical-outage hot-fix, engineers deploy the patch (b) first and run the automated test suite (a) only afterward if time allows. Reasoning: Here b occurs before or even without a, breaking the ‘preceded-by’ requirement.\n3. In urgent onboarding, IT provisions the account (b) while HR finishes creating the employee record (a) the next day. Reasoning: The provisioning action b can occur one or more days before a, contradicting the rule.\n\n\nCoExistence(a,b): a and b occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every new support case triggers a (open-ticket record) and, in the same transaction, auto-creates b (initial customer-reply template). Reasoning: The system executes a composite routine that writes both database rows atomically, so whenever a is logged b is logged too, and neither appears alone.\n2. For each vendor purchase, the ERP posts a (goods-received note) and simultaneously posts b (accounts-payable accrual) in the same commit. Reasoning: Posting logic is wrapped in a single database transaction—if either insert fails the whole transaction rolls back—therefore the system state contains both or neither.\n3. Publishing a news article executes a (content push to CDN) and b (metadata push to search index) as a locked job pair—neither job can be run in isolation. Reasoning: The deploy orchestrator groups them under one job ID; a switch disables standalone execution, guaranteeing paired occurrence.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. For micro-refunds, the agent can execute b (instant payout) while the fraud-check a is skipped. Reasoning: A valid path exists in which b occurs but a does not, so the pair does not always appear together.\n2. A legacy printer service fires b (shipping-label print) on address verification, but if inventory allocation a does not occur, the label still prints. Reasoning: The system can produce b even though a has not completed, so the two are not inseparable.\n3. When a student repeats a passed module, the registrar records a (module enrollment) but suppresses b (fee payment). Reasoning: This branch shows a without b, violating the rule.\n\n  \nNotCoExistence(a,b): a and b never occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. In the loan pipeline, low-risk applications flow through a (automatic approval) while high-risk ones are routed to b (manual committee review). Reasoning: The risk-based router selects exactly one mutually exclusive branch; a case flagged low-risk can never enter the high-risk branch and vice-versa, so no single run contains both a and b.\n2. At checkout a customer must choose either a (credit-card payment) or b (cash-on-delivery); the payment gateway disables the unselected option. Reasoning: The UI enforces a single-selection radio button and downstream code validates one—and only one—payment type, ensuring the two activities never co-appear in the same order.\n3. Regulations permit a sample to be processed via a (wet-lab chemical protocol) for liquid specimens or b (dry-lab bioinformatics) for genomic data, explicitly banning mixed handling. Reasoning: Compliance software validates specimen type before queuing the job and rejects any attempt to schedule the alternate protocol, so a single specimen workflow can contain only one of the two.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Borderline loan applications first undergo a (automated scoring) and then proceed to b (manual credit-committee review) before a decision is issued. Reasoning: A single borderline application clearly contains the sequence a → b, so both activities occur together.\n2. For VIP travel bookings, the system performs a (automatic ticket issuance) while simultaneously dispatching b (manual travel-agent confirmation) as an extra layer of service. Reasoning: Each VIP booking spawns both automated and manual tasks, so a and b co-exist in the same booking workflow.\n3. When a customer changes address on an open order, support runs a (address verification) and then launches b (fraud re-check) within the same service call. Reasoning: The single service request explicitly chains a and b together.\n\nNotSuccession(a,b): b cannot occur after a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1.

The supported declarative constraint templates in our framework are:\n- AtMost1(a)\n- AtLeast1(a)\n- Response(a, b)\n- Precedence(a, b)\n- CoExistence(a, b)\n- NotCoExistence(a, b)\n- NotSuccession(a, b)\n- RespondedExistence(a, b)\n** Only use these templates.

The first and second elements must be a single activity\nIf several valid constraints refer to the same activities, keep only the most restrictive one. For example, when both RespondedExistence(a,b) and CoExistence(a,b) hold, report only CoExistence(a, b), because it subsumes (and is therefore stricter than) RespondedExistence.\n\n\nInteraction Protocol\nWhen you receive a new input:\n1) You may write reasoning steps (internally) before producing the JSON object — but never include them in the output.\n2) Once confident, generate and return the JSON object containing the constraints.\n3) Do not include explanation or commentary in the output.\n\n\nSome examples to learn the constraints and reasoning better:\nAtMost1(a): a occurs at most once. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Activity a may appear only as the final step of the project. Reasoning: Because a project has exactly one last step, a cannot be repeated.\n2. Completing activity a requires a single-use safety clearance that can be issued only once per project. Reasoning: Once the unique clearance is consumed, a second a cannot obtain it, so no second occurrence is legal.\n3. The project terminates immediately once activity a has been executed. Reasoning: Ending the schedule right after a leaves no remaining time slots in which another a could happen.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. The maintenance routine begins with a, proceeds through b and c, and then repeats a before concluding with d. Reasoning: a appears both at the start and again before the end—two occurrences.\n2. Every four-hour production cycle executes the sequence a, b, c; the plant runs three such cycles per day. Reasoning: Each cycle contains an a, so the day’s schedule contains a three separate times.\n3. The curriculum covers unit a in week 1 and revisits unit a for advanced exercises in week 4. Reasoning: The same activity a is taught twice in the single course timeline.\n\n\nAtLeast1(a): a occurs at least once, which means the existance of activity a is mandatory. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every case begins with activity a for baseline approval before any other work may proceed. Reasoning: The word “begins” makes a the very first step of every project run, guaranteeing one occurrence.\n2. In each instance, teams must perform activity a to certify the data set’s integrity. Reasoning: Filing the report is part of the process, and a is declared a mandatory predecessor, so at least one a precedes filing.\n3. Any customer-service ticket is automatically routed to a (triage) before it can enter the resolution queue. Reasoning: Since tickets must pass through the queue to be resolved, each ticket necessarily triggers one execution of a.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. When an order arrives with a pre-approved credit flag, the workflow jumps straight to b for planning and never calls a. Reasoning: The conditional branch bypasses a entirely whenever the flag is present, so some executions contain zero a’s.\n2. During off-season maintenance, technicians may optionally perform a or proceed directly to c if no calibration is needed. Reasoning: Because a is labeled ‘optional,’ a valid path exists in which the technicians skip it.\n3. A legacy integration still routes certain tickets directly to c, bypassing a and b altogether. Reasoning: Tickets entering through the legacy path never encounter a, violating the mandatory-presence requirement.\n\n\nResponse(a,b): If a occurs, then b occurs after a.\nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Each new client request triggers a for intake, followed immediately by b for verification before any other tasks may start. Reasoning: a is hard-coded to be immediately succeeded by b; no branch exists between them, so every time a appears, b necessarily follows.\n2. In the onboarding pipeline, once a (collecting identity documents) completes, the workflow engine automatically schedules b (identity validation) as the very next step. Reasoning: The engine inserts b right after a without user discretion, eliminating any path where a occurs and b does not.\n3. For every premium order, a (fraud screening) is executed and, upon success, the system proceeds to b (payment capture) before shipping. Reasoning: The success path from a programmatically advances to b; orders cannot ship (the process goal) until b completes, so a ➔ b is enforced.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-checkout flow, the system executes a (payment capture) and ships the order immediately, skipping the fraud-review step b. Reasoning: A occurs, but b never happens, so the implication fails.\n2. During a critical-outage fix, engineers apply a (hot patch) and close the incident log without performing the normal post-patch verification b. Reasoning: The emergency path lets the process end with a but without a subsequent b.\n3. For VIP passengers, security screening b is completed pre-flight, and if an ID issue arises later, staff perform a secondary identity swipe a right at the gate. Reasoning: Here b occurs before a, not after it, breaking the required order.\n\n\nPrecedence(a,b): b occurs only if preceded by a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The manufacturing line enables b (packaging) only after a sensor logs a (final assembly complete). Reasoning: The control logic keeps the packaging station disabled until the assembly-complete flag from a is present, so every time b runs an earlier a must already have finished.\n2. Within the insurance-claims app, b (payout) can be triggered solely when the system finds a prior a (manager approval) entry for that claim. Reasoning: The trigger condition for b is the existence of an approval record; consequently, whenever b happens the claim’s history necessarily contains a preceding a. \n3. The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete. Reasoning: The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-refund path, an agent can execute b (instant payout) with a supervisor override even when a (fraud check) has not been run. Reasoning: The override permits b to happen in runs where a never took place, so b is not guaranteed to be preceded by a.\n2. During a critical-outage hot-fix, engineers deploy the patch (b) first and run the automated test suite (a) only afterward if time allows. Reasoning: Here b occurs before or even without a, breaking the ‘preceded-by’ requirement.\n3. In urgent onboarding, IT provisions the account (b) while HR finishes creating the employee record (a) the next day. Reasoning: The provisioning action b can occur one or more days before a, contradicting the rule.\n\n\nCoExistence(a,b): a and b occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every new support case triggers a (open-ticket record) and, in the same transaction, auto-creates b (initial customer-reply template). Reasoning: The system executes a composite routine that writes both database rows atomically, so whenever a is logged b is logged too, and neither appears alone.\n2. For each vendor purchase, the ERP posts a (goods-received note) and simultaneously posts b (accounts-payable accrual) in the same commit. Reasoning: Posting logic is wrapped in a single database transaction—if either insert fails the whole transaction rolls back—therefore the system state contains both or neither.\n3. Publishing a news article executes a (content push to CDN) and b (metadata push to search index) as a locked job pair—neither job can be run in isolation. Reasoning: The deploy orchestrator groups them under one job ID; a switch disables standalone execution, guaranteeing paired occurrence.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. For micro-refunds, the agent can execute b (instant payout) while the fraud-check a is skipped. Reasoning: A valid path exists in which b occurs but a does not, so the pair does not always appear together.\n2. A legacy printer service fires b (shipping-label print) on address verification, but if inventory allocation a does not occur, the label still prints. Reasoning: The system can produce b even though a has not completed, so the two are not inseparable.\n3. When a student repeats a passed module, the registrar records a (module enrollment) but suppresses b (fee payment). Reasoning: This branch shows a without b, violating the rule.\n\n  \nNotCoExistence(a,b): a and b never occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. In the loan pipeline, low-risk applications flow through a (automatic approval) while high-risk ones are routed to b (manual committee review). Reasoning: The risk-based router selects exactly one mutually exclusive branch; a case flagged low-risk can never enter the high-risk branch and vice-versa, so no single run contains both a and b.\n2. At checkout a customer must choose either a (credit-card payment) or b (cash-on-delivery); the payment gateway disables the unselected option. Reasoning: The UI enforces a single-selection radio button and downstream code validates one—and only one—payment type, ensuring the two activities never co-appear in the same order.\n3. Regulations permit a sample to be processed via a (wet-lab chemical protocol) for liquid specimens or b (dry-lab bioinformatics) for genomic data, explicitly banning mixed handling. Reasoning: Compliance software validates specimen type before queuing the job and rejects any attempt to schedule the alternate protocol, so a single specimen workflow can contain only one of the two.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Borderline loan applications first undergo a (automated scoring) and then proceed to b (manual credit-committee review) before a decision is issued. Reasoning: A single borderline application clearly contains the sequence a → b, so both activities occur together.\n2. For VIP travel bookings, the system performs a (automatic ticket issuance) while simultaneously dispatching b (manual travel-agent confirmation) as an extra layer of service. Reasoning: Each VIP booking spawns both automated and manual tasks, so a and b co-exist in the same booking workflow.\n3. When a customer changes address on an open order, support runs a (address verification) and then launches b (fraud re-check) within the same service call. Reasoning: The single service request explicitly chains a and b together.\n\nNotSuccession(a,b): b cannot occur after a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The customer-complaint workflow finishes with a (final client sign-off); when that step is saved the ticket auto-closes, making b (internal escalation) impossible afterwards. Reasoning: Activity a terminates the case, so no subsequent task—including b—can be executed.\n2. During checkout, b (fraud screening) is run before payment capture, and once a (payment capture) succeeds the order is locked from further screening. Reasoning: b is always completed earlier in the timeline; after a, the lock prevents any new b event.\n3. In emergency releases, committing a (force merge to main) marks CI job b (code linting) as ‘skipped’ and locks the pipeline. Reasoning: The status change blocks b from running after the merge.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Auditors record a (preliminary sign-off) and then launch b (final compliance audit) to complete the dossier. Reasoning: The workflow explicitly places b after a, proving the forbidden order can occur.\n2. The emergency-release pipeline performs a (force deploy) and only afterwards runs b (post-deploy regression tests). Reasoning: A single deployment run contains a first and b later, so b follows a.\n3. The warehouse seals pallets with a (shipment sealing) and later performs b (random quality-inspection pulls) before loading the truck. Reasoning: Quality inspections b are scheduled chronologically after pallet sealing a.\n\nRespondedExistence(a,b): If a occurs in the trace, then b occurs as well. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Any training session that records a (hands-on lab) must also show b (theory module) on the same attendance sheet. Reasoning: The attendance sheet is invalid without entries for both modules; thus a session containing a always contains b, with order left to the organizer.\n2. Every incident record that contains a (temporary workaround) is required by policy to include b (permanent resolution) in the same incident file. Reasoning: The data model treats the pair as mandatory fields on the same record; whichever is entered first, the other must exist before closure, so any trace with a inevitably contains b, but timing is flexible.\n3. If a sprint backlog includes a (security epic), governance checks confirm that b (pen-test task) is also on the board. Reasoning: Board validation happens at sprint start and end, ensuring both items co-appear even though teams pick their own ordering.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1.

    "full_prompt": "Task Overview:\nYou are an assistant that helps translate free-text process descriptions into declarative process constraints.\n\nYour goal is to:\n1) Identify declarative constraints from the text.\n2) Return them in strict JSON format (see below).\n\nJSON Output Format:\nYou must always return a single valid JSON object in this format:\n** Do not return any explanation or markdown. Only return a single valid JSON object exactly like this.**\n{\n  \"constraints\": [\n    {\n      \"template\": \"Response\",\n      \"parameters\": [[\"a\"], [\"b\"]]\n    },\n    {\n      \"template\": \"AtMost1\",\n      \"parameters\": [[\"c\"]]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nSupported Templates:\nConsider only the following declarative constraint definitions where a, b, c, and d are activities and template example-template(x,y) specifies a template named \"example-template\" and x and y can be one of the activities from the set of all activities. The supported declarative constraint templates in our framework are:\n- AtMost1(a)\n- AtLeast1(a)\n- Response(a, b)\n- Precedence(a, b)\n- CoExistence(a, b)\n- NotCoExistence(a, b)\n- NotSuccession(a, b)\n- RespondedExistence(a, b)\n** Only use these templates. Do not invent new ones or use logical operators like “or”. **\n\n\nSome more instructions:\nIt is not possible to generate constraints like Response(a, (b or c)). The first and second elements must be a single activity\nIf several valid constraints refer to the same activities, keep only the most restrictive one. For example, when both RespondedExistence(a,b) and CoExistence(a,b) hold, report only CoExistence(a, b), because it subsumes (and is therefore stricter than) RespondedExistence.\n\n\nInteraction Protocol\nWhen you receive a new input:\n1) You may write reasoning steps (internally) before producing the JSON object — but never include them in the output.\n2) Once confident, generate and return the JSON object containing the constraints.\n3) Do not include explanation or commentary in the output.\n\n\nSome examples to learn the constraints and reasoning better:\nAtMost1(a): a occurs at most once. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Activity a may appear only as the final step of the project. Reasoning: Because a project has exactly one last step, a cannot be repeated.\n2. Completing activity a requires a single-use safety clearance that can be issued only once per project. Reasoning: Once the unique clearance is consumed, a second a cannot obtain it, so no second occurrence is legal.\n3. The project terminates immediately once activity a has been executed. Reasoning: Ending the schedule right after a leaves no remaining time slots in which another a could happen.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. The maintenance routine begins with a, proceeds through b and c, and then repeats a before concluding with d. Reasoning: a appears both at the start and again before the end—two occurrences.\n2. Every four-hour production cycle executes the sequence a, b, c; the plant runs three such cycles per day. Reasoning: Each cycle contains an a, so the day’s schedule contains a three separate times.\n3. The curriculum covers unit a in week 1 and revisits unit a for advanced exercises in week 4. Reasoning: The same activity a is taught twice in the single course timeline.\n\n\nAtLeast1(a): a occurs at least once, which means the existance of activity a is mandatory. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every case begins with activity a for baseline approval before any other work may proceed. Reasoning: The word “begins” makes a the very first step of every project run, guaranteeing one occurrence.\n2. In each instance, teams must perform activity a to certify the data set’s integrity. Reasoning: Filing the report is part of the process, and a is declared a mandatory predecessor, so at least one a precedes filing.\n3. Any customer-service ticket is automatically routed to a (triage) before it can enter the resolution queue. Reasoning: Since tickets must pass through the queue to be resolved, each ticket necessarily triggers one execution of a.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. When an order arrives with a pre-approved credit flag, the workflow jumps straight to b for planning and never calls a. Reasoning: The conditional branch bypasses a entirely whenever the flag is present, so some executions contain zero a’s.\n2. During off-season maintenance, technicians may optionally perform a or proceed directly to c if no calibration is needed. Reasoning: Because a is labeled ‘optional,’ a valid path exists in which the technicians skip it.\n3. A legacy integration still routes certain tickets directly to c, bypassing a and b altogether. Reasoning: Tickets entering through the legacy path never encounter a, violating the mandatory-presence requirement.\n\n\nResponse(a,b): If a occurs, then b occurs after a.\nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Each new client request triggers a for intake, followed immediately by b for verification before any other tasks may start. Reasoning: a is hard-coded to be immediately succeeded by b; no branch exists between them, so every time a appears, b necessarily follows.\n2. In the onboarding pipeline, once a (collecting identity documents) completes, the workflow engine automatically schedules b (identity validation) as the very next step. Reasoning: The engine inserts b right after a without user discretion, eliminating any path where a occurs and b does not.\n3. For every premium order, a (fraud screening) is executed and, upon success, the system proceeds to b (payment capture) before shipping. Reasoning: The success path from a programmatically advances to b; orders cannot ship (the process goal) until b completes, so a ➔ b is enforced.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-checkout flow, the system executes a (payment capture) and ships the order immediately, skipping the fraud-review step b. Reasoning: A occurs, but b never happens, so the implication fails.\n2. During a critical-outage fix, engineers apply a (hot patch) and close the incident log without performing the normal post-patch verification b. Reasoning: The emergency path lets the process end with a but without a subsequent b.\n3. For VIP passengers, security screening b is completed pre-flight, and if an ID issue arises later, staff perform a secondary identity swipe a right at the gate. Reasoning: Here b occurs before a, not after it, breaking the required order.\n\n\nPrecedence(a,b): b occurs only if preceded by a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The manufacturing line enables b (packaging) only after a sensor logs a (final assembly complete). Reasoning: The control logic keeps the packaging station disabled until the assembly-complete flag from a is present, so every time b runs an earlier a must already have finished.\n2. Within the insurance-claims app, b (payout) can be triggered solely when the system finds a prior a (manager approval) entry for that claim. Reasoning: The trigger condition for b is the existence of an approval record; consequently, whenever b happens the claim’s history necessarily contains a preceding a. \n3. The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete. Reasoning: The compliance checklist forbids auditors from adding b (final signature) until a (risk assessment) is marked complete.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the express-refund path, an agent can execute b (instant payout) with a supervisor override even when a (fraud check) has not been run. Reasoning: The override permits b to happen in runs where a never took place, so b is not guaranteed to be preceded by a.\n2. During a critical-outage hot-fix, engineers deploy the patch (b) first and run the automated test suite (a) only afterward if time allows. Reasoning: Here b occurs before or even without a, breaking the ‘preceded-by’ requirement.\n3. In urgent onboarding, IT provisions the account (b) while HR finishes creating the employee record (a) the next day. Reasoning: The provisioning action b can occur one or more days before a, contradicting the rule.\n\n\nCoExistence(a,b): a and b occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Every new support case triggers a (open-ticket record) and, in the same transaction, auto-creates b (initial customer-reply template). Reasoning: The system executes a composite routine that writes both database rows atomically, so whenever a is logged b is logged too, and neither appears alone.\n2. For each vendor purchase, the ERP posts a (goods-received note) and simultaneously posts b (accounts-payable accrual) in the same commit. Reasoning: Posting logic is wrapped in a single database transaction—if either insert fails the whole transaction rolls back—therefore the system state contains both or neither.\n3. Publishing a news article executes a (content push to CDN) and b (metadata push to search index) as a locked job pair—neither job can be run in isolation. Reasoning: The deploy orchestrator groups them under one job ID; a switch disables standalone execution, guaranteeing paired occurrence.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. For micro-refunds, the agent can execute b (instant payout) while the fraud-check a is skipped. Reasoning: A valid path exists in which b occurs but a does not, so the pair does not always appear together.\n2. A legacy printer service fires b (shipping-label print) on address verification, but if inventory allocation a does not occur, the label still prints. Reasoning: The system can produce b even though a has not completed, so the two are not inseparable.\n3. When a student repeats a passed module, the registrar records a (module enrollment) but suppresses b (fee payment). Reasoning: This branch shows a without b, violating the rule.\n\n  \nNotCoExistence(a,b): a and b never occur together. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. In the loan pipeline, low-risk applications flow through a (automatic approval) while high-risk ones are routed to b (manual committee review). Reasoning: The risk-based router selects exactly one mutually exclusive branch; a case flagged low-risk can never enter the high-risk branch and vice-versa, so no single run contains both a and b.\n2. At checkout a customer must choose either a (credit-card payment) or b (cash-on-delivery); the payment gateway disables the unselected option. Reasoning: The UI enforces a single-selection radio button and downstream code validates one—and only one—payment type, ensuring the two activities never co-appear in the same order.\n3. Regulations permit a sample to be processed via a (wet-lab chemical protocol) for liquid specimens or b (dry-lab bioinformatics) for genomic data, explicitly banning mixed handling. Reasoning: Compliance software validates specimen type before queuing the job and rejects any attempt to schedule the alternate protocol, so a single specimen workflow can contain only one of the two.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Borderline loan applications first undergo a (automated scoring) and then proceed to b (manual credit-committee review) before a decision is issued. Reasoning: A single borderline application clearly contains the sequence a → b, so both activities occur together.\n2. For VIP travel bookings, the system performs a (automatic ticket issuance) while simultaneously dispatching b (manual travel-agent confirmation) as an extra layer of service. Reasoning: Each VIP booking spawns both automated and manual tasks, so a and b co-exist in the same booking workflow.\n3. When a customer changes address on an open order, support runs a (address verification) and then launches b (fraud re-check) within the same service call. Reasoning: The single service request explicitly chains a and b together.\n\nNotSuccession(a,b): b cannot occur after a. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. The customer-complaint workflow finishes with a (final client sign-off); when that step is saved the ticket auto-closes, making b (internal escalation) impossible afterwards. Reasoning: Activity a terminates the case, so no subsequent task—including b—can be executed.\n2. During checkout, b (fraud screening) is run before payment capture, and once a (payment capture) succeeds the order is locked from further screening. Reasoning: b is always completed earlier in the timeline; after a, the lock prevents any new b event.\n3. In emergency releases, committing a (force merge to main) marks CI job b (code linting) as ‘skipped’ and locks the pipeline. Reasoning: The status change blocks b from running after the merge.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. Auditors record a (preliminary sign-off) and then launch b (final compliance audit) to complete the dossier. Reasoning: The workflow explicitly places b after a, proving the forbidden order can occur.\n2. The emergency-release pipeline performs a (force deploy) and only afterwards runs b (post-deploy regression tests). Reasoning: A single deployment run contains a first and b later, so b follows a.\n3. The warehouse seals pallets with a (shipment sealing) and later performs b (random quality-inspection pulls) before loading the truck. Reasoning: Quality inspections b are scheduled chronologically after pallet sealing a.\n\nRespondedExistence(a,b): If a occurs in the trace, then b occurs as well. \nSome examples satisfying this constraint:\n1. Any training session that records a (hands-on lab) must also show b (theory module) on the same attendance sheet. Reasoning: The attendance sheet is invalid without entries for both modules; thus a session containing a always contains b, with order left to the organizer.\n2. Every incident record that contains a (temporary workaround) is required by policy to include b (permanent resolution) in the same incident file. Reasoning: The data model treats the pair as mandatory fields on the same record; whichever is entered first, the other must exist before closure, so any trace with a inevitably contains b, but timing is flexible.\n3. If a sprint backlog includes a (security epic), governance checks confirm that b (pen-test task) is also on the board. Reasoning: Board validation happens at sprint start and end, ensuring both items co-appear even though teams pick their own ordering.\nSome examples violating this constraint:\n1. In the quick-refund lane, an agent can execute a (issue refund) and close the ticket, while b (root-cause investigation) is marked ‘optional’ and often skipped. Reasoning: A legitimate trace exists where a is present and b never appears, contradicting the implication.\n2. For VIP travelers, the airline auto-issues a (boarding pass) but waives b (secondary identity check) unless a random audit flag is raised. Reasoning: Many VIP traces show a without the corresponding b event.\n3. A late-stage sales opportunity logs a (verbal commitment) immediately, while b (formal contract upload) may be omitted if the deal falls through. Reasoning: When a deal collapses, the trace holds a but never records b.\n\nFor each task, I provide the set of activity labels that exist in the process.\n\n\nThe list of activities used in this process are the following.
